            "NA SR\t0601771\tAlready an accomplished adventure and 'ultramarathon' cyclist, the 31-year-old Sudbury native will push himself to new heights -- or lows, depending on geography -- in the Race Across America, a 4,800-kilometre bicycle race from Oceanside, Calif., to Annapolis, Md., across 16 states, through mountains, deserts, hills and plains. But less than a month before hitting the highway on June 13, Lane said he wasn't nervous about facing one of the greatest challenges of his athletic career. \"It's more respect -- a lot of respect for what it is,\" Lane said during a press conference at Laurentian University on Thursday. \"I went to California and did the first 500 miles and I did the last 500 through West Virginia, to get more of an idea what it is, and I have more respect for what other people have done in the past and just how difficult it is.\" 'Difficult' may seem an understatement to some. Not only does the race require Lane to be in top physical condition, but also extremely mentally tough. Race Across America competitors spend 22 or 23 hours each day on the bike, sleeping for as little as an hour at a time. \"I have been adventure racing for 10 years and those races last about five to 10 days and you only sleep about one or two hours a day,\" said Lane, a graduate of Laurentian's adventure leadership program who works as a paramedic. \"And while you never really get used to it, I have kind of gotten used to how it feels. \"But yeah, that is one of the biggest challenges, the sleep deprivation, not just for myself, but for but support group, too. They'll sleep much more, of course, about six hours a night, but they'll be pretty stressed, I'm sure.\" That support group will include a few people who constantly follow Lane in a minivan, ready to provide food and water and meet his medical, mechanical or moral needs. \"They'll have this amazing stereo system and a big PA speaker on top of the vehicle, so they'll have a mic and they can play music, shout encouragement or obscenities, whatever,\" Lane said with a chuckle. \"And I'll have a two-way radio on me at all times.\" The rest will reside in an RV that will leapfrog along the course, stopping for Lane's sleep sessions. But he'll eat, drink and even answer nature's call from atop his bike. If he finishes the race, he'll be only the sixth Canadian to do so. \"What I'm going for is rookie of the year, which is about the best thing you can get next to winning,\" Lane said. \"And to be top three. I'm aiming for the podium.\" Training for Race Across America is difficult enough -- \"like another full-time job,\" Lane says -- but he has done it with a pair of surgically-altered knees. He went under the knife twice in 2010, once in March and again in October. \"It wasn't an injury as much as a genetic predisposition,\" Lane said. \"My kneecaps were too high. So I found a surgeon at Sunnybrook and he basically broke my legs apart, lowered my kneecaps and put them back together. \"I have recovered well and I'm better than ever.\" The doctor told him to avoid running or lifting weights for a couple of years, hence the shift to a straight cycling event. A pair of independent filmmakers plans to follow Lane as well, making a documentary about his trip. The trek will benefit science, as well, as members of Laurentian's school of human kinetics will test the effects of the race on the cyclist's body. \"We will be collecting some data,\" said Sebastien Nault, a sessional lecturer at the university. \"We'll be doing some physical research to see what are the effects on his condition throughout the race.\" He's also using the race as a platform to raise money for the SickKids Foundation, the not-for- profit charity which raises funds on behalf of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. \"We had hoped to raise $50,000,\" Lane said. \"I don't know if we'll quite get there, but SickKids is fantastic to work with and they're happy with whatever we can raise, not just money, but awareness, too. \"They're a fantastic charity. I work as a paramedic, with the City of Greater Sudbury and with Ornge, so I'm in direct contact with SickKids and they do incredible work.\" The Laurentian Alumni Association presented Lane with a cheque for $10,000 at Thursday's presser. More information on Lane's upcoming race can be found at www.teamhammerfest.comor www.raceacrossamerica.org. \n",
            "OP OB\t3160437\tBeing a Successful Band Has Nothing to Do With Talent [Editor's Note : Are you a musician? Is your group having issues? Ask Fan Landers ! Critic Jessica Hopper has played in and managed bands, toured internationally, booked shows, produced records, worked as a publicist, and is the author of The Girls' Guide to Rocking , a how-to for teen ladies. She is here to help you stop doing it wrong. Send your problems to her -- confidentiality is assured, unless you want to use your drama as a ticket to Internet microfame.] Dear Fan, We're having a really hard time finding an audience. We have a solid album, and no one has heard it. We play an absolutely killer live show and we can't get enough people to come and see us play. The people that do make it to our shows always have a great time and we get a lot of good feedback. We've started to solve the problem by doing showcases, where eight bands play, and this tends to draw a larger crowd, but we are READY to move on and do great things. I admit I am clueless at marketing, at generating interest, even the basic aspects of talking to people about my music. I know there's no magic formula, but I'd really appreciate any tips or advice you could give about what I could work on. We are genuinely talented and we keep making progress, I just feel we are capable of so much more. Sincerely, Us Dear Us, Your letter gets at the crux of why it sucks to be in a band; it's a little heartbreaking. Reading over your letter and listening to the link to your band's album on Bandcamp, I see that your problem is actually something other than what you think it is. Getting people to your shows, having a record people like doesn't really have anything to do with talent. This is the great myth of the music industry. Sure, beautiful songs and punchy hooks help, but you need to purge your mind of the idea that if you just make great songs and play them well that everything else will fall into place, because you deserve it. Mourn the death of that dream of music as a meritocracy and that the world is going to discover your genius and come scampering to your doorstep to pad your path with dollars. Thinking that way will make the reality of being in a band really discouraging and painful. You live in a city that is a great place to be a musician... if you are a country session player. You are a macho bar rock kind of band and admittedly horrible at networking or self-promoting. Does another member of your band have any palpable social skill or gladhanding ability that you can call upon? Could you recruit a second guitar player from another band who has connections to bookers and other bands? You guys need to work on ingratiating yourself into your city's rock scene and getting on the radar of the people that make things happen within it -- bookers, club staff, other bands. Think about the marginally talented local band that gets all the plum opening slots on the big national-band shows and get annoyed. Let that competitive fire fuel your pro-active networking. Covet thy neighbor's opening slot. You know what I mean. Be a super nice dude, accommodating, show gratitude to the people that help you, don't act like you deserve things and people will want to work with you again just on the basis of that. Most dudes in bands act like the world owes them and they never say thanks and they want everyone else to make it happen for them. No one wants to work with a big baby. Nepotism is a real thing. Anyone who tells you otherwise is not well-connected. \n",
            "NA IN NE DP\t1445020\t'I always like to think of myself as a cartoon, and now I'm a Sim!' Katy Perry is immortalised as a computer character Her real life might be in turmoil, but Katy Perry couldn't be happier in the virtual world of The Sims. The singer is to join the popular video game that simulates real life and families. Just weeks after the end of her marriage to Russell Brand the 27 year old star has been named as the star of a new game. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO... Game on!: Katy Perry has been immortalised as a computer game character in The Sims 3 Showtime Her tie in with the makers of The Sims will feature Perry-themed content and virtual goods, including clothing, hairstyles, furniture and props. Perry, a fan of the game, said: 'I love how you're able to play out different stories through your Sims characters - giving them different careers and watching them succeed. It's cool to see the Sims' stage performances in The Sims 3 Showtime decked out just like my California Dreams Tour - even my cotton candy video screens are in there! 'I always like to think of myself as a cartoon, and now I'm a Sim!' Sim-ple: Katy is thrilled to become a part of the virtual reality game Electronic Arts, makers of The Sims, said Perry will play a key role in developing the games featuring her likeness. The deal includes creating Perry-themed in-game items and virtual goods and begins with a Perry-themed collector's edition of The Sims 3 Showtime, which will go on sale in March. Steve Schnur, executive of music for EA, said that a Sims-powered music video of Perry's Hot and Cold made in The Sims 2 became one of the most popular \"Simlish\" music videos to date. Sweet touch: Sets from Katy Perry's tour feature in the game Dance break: The computer game pulls out all the stops to recreate Katy's world Lifelike: Katy Perry made sure she had her say when it came to creating her character 'Today marks the start of the most integrated and exciting collaboration with any artist in the history of The Sims,' said Schnur. 'Katy Perry has been a fan of The Sims for several years, and her Simlish recording of her hit Hot and Cold featured in The Sims 2 series quickly became the most popular Simlish music video to date...No performer could better represent the humor and fun of The Sims brand.' The partnership will kick off with a special Collector's Edition for The Sims 3 Showtime, launching in March. Perry will also be featured in advertising and marketing campaigns for the brand. Key role: Katy will have lots of involvement with the brand in her three in-game deal Feeling fruity: Katy is known for her elaborate concerts, recreated in the game Limited edition: A special collector's version of the game has been released in Katy's honour Will she have a tall lanky ex drug addict ex husband to play with? And a virtual whirlwind romance and 5 minute marriage? Let's hope The Sims have more suitable virtual boys for her to go out with - maybe not tick the 'ex sex addict' box again Katy - never a good idea..... \n",
            "NA SR\t3060117\tQPR vs Southampton - Match preview and team news Friday 16 November 2012 The bottom two of the Premier League meet on Saturday, with Queens Park Rangers looking for their first win of the season at the 12th time of asking. Mark Hughes' side have picked up four draws so far, but have to go back 6 months for their last league win, at home to Stoke at the beginning of May. All is not lost just yet for R's fans - one win would put them two points behind 17th place Aston Villa. Southampton are sticking by the manager that led them to successive promotions, regardless of Premier League performances, yet Nigel Adkins will be desperately disappointed to have picked up just one solitary victory - now seven games back. Defeats to West Brom, Spurs and West Ham in recent weeks have kept the Saints at the foot of the table. This weekend QPR will have their squad depth tested - Stephane M'Bia is out suspended, while Fabio (hamstring), will miss the tie. The club await fitness news on Jamie Mackie, Kieron Dyer, Ryan Nelson and Park Ji-Sung. Djibril Cisse will start up-front, preferred to Bobby Zamora. Southampton have most of their first team members available, with just Frazer Richardson out with a thigh injury. \n",
            "NA NE\t0119728\tSearch age: Search in: US says it's ready to talk to Taliban chief Dean Nelson Washington US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the House foreign affairs committee. She told the committee the US would continue to 'fight, talk and build' in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Photo: Alex Wong WASHINGTON is ready to negotiate with Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader who sheltered Osama bin Laden as he plotted the September 11 attacks. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has told a Congress committee that the US regards his involvement as crucial to the prospects for peace in Afghanistan. Her comments have been taken as a significant shift in US policy, from moves to divide the Taliban-led insurgency and isolate Mullah Omar to an acknowledgement of his leadership. Earlier this month it emerged that US officials had met leaders of the Haqqani network, the Taliban faction blamed for some of the most devastating attacks on US and NATO forces in Afghanistan. Advertisement Last week, the faction's commander, Sirajuddin Haqqani, warned Washington that only the Quetta Shura, the Taliban-led militant organisation, could negotiate a peace deal and that his fighters would not be divided. In an appearance before the House foreign affairs committee, Mrs Clinton said the US would continue to ''fight, talk and build'' in Afghanistan and Pakistan to test any willingness to negotiate. She said there was ''evidence going both ways'' on its intentions. Doubts were raised over the Taliban leadership's intentions after the assassination last month by a suicide bomber of Burhanuddin Rabbani, the former Afghan president and the head of the High Peace Council. Mrs Clinton said last month's Haqqani meeting was not a ''negotiation'' and that no meetings had followed it, but stressed that any future negotiations with the Taliban would need the Quetta Shura's blessing. A US Defence Department report to Congress released on Friday said violence in Afghanistan went down in the past year, reversing five straight years of sharp increases. Still, the insurgency remained ''capable'' and ''resilient'', and its havens across the border in Pakistan remained the biggest risks ''to the process of turning security gains into a durable, stable Afghanistan'', according to the report. The violence dropped particularly in the country's south-west, west and north, the Pentagon reported. Security in the country's eastern region remains tenuous because of the sanctuary and support from Pakistan. The report sets the stage for President Barack Obama to proceed with his plan to give the Afghan government full command of its security by the end of 2014. The US has begun to pull out troops, with the first 10,000 out of almost 100,000 expected to leave by the end of this year. ''The most significant development during this reporting period is the reduction in year-over-year violence,'' the Pentagon said in the congressionally mandated report. \n",
            "IN OP DT\t3119905\tWelcome to India Here at The Great Recovery HQ we have been glued to our TV screens for the last few weeks watching BBC 2's three part documentary series: Welcome to India . Over 1 in 6 of the world's population live in India, and during the series we see the film crew follow a handful of 'backstreet entrepreneurs' who are all \"learning to survive in a crowded world\". In episode 1 we meet 23 year old Kaale who has moved from the countryside to the city of Kolkata in search of gold. Gold is a precious metal with huge cultural significance in India -- it acts as insurance, and Indian housewives own an incredible 11% of the world's gold stocks. That's more than the USA, Germany and Switzerland put together. Kaale lives with 20 other men in a small room in Kolkata's Jewellery district, and wakes at 3am every morning to begin work. The huge mass of goldsmiths who live and work in the area leave particles of gold on the street which falls off their clothes, hands and hair when they wash, and gathers with the dirt and dust. Kaale and his friends spend hours sweeping the streets and using traditional American gold panning techniques to extract the metal. \"When people look at the street, all they see is garbage... But we know what's hiding here.\" During the hour long programme, we see Kaale taking his gold panning venture even further by lowering himself down the tiny drains of Kolkata, extracting sack loads of 'sludge' and selling it to Javed, whose family own a backstreet gold panning workshop on a disused bank of the River Ganges. Here, Javed's 20 employees work tirelessly to first dry the mud, then sieve and crush it into powder (the only mechanised part of the process) before using 19 th century Californian techniques with a wooden board and water to massage the mud to trap gold particles in tiny grooves on the board. Mercury is added to the remaining mud to 'stick' to the gold, and this is moulded into 'ranga' balls which are heated to first drive off any impurities, then to melt off the mercury. All that remains is one final smelting with nitric acid and they are left with 24 carat gold! These tiny gold particles that could so easily be dismissed as lost are being meticulously sourced and implemented back into circulation. In episode 2 we meet Kanye, who also works recycling metals, but on a much bigger scale. Mumbai is home to a cargo ship graveyard, and it is down to 16,000 workers to 'butcher' these 12,000 tonne ships from across the world. It is an extremely dangerous job -- every part of the ginormous vessels is taken apart by hand. Not a bit of the boats go to waste. The reusable parts go to the market and supply the Indian construction industry with cheap recycled steel, and the bits that cannot be reused are turned into something else and sold on. Even the tiny specs of iron that gather on the floor are collected and sold on. Moving away from metals, to plastic recycling: Johora lives with her 12 children and husband alongside the railway tracks in Kolkata. She has worked her way up from a rag-picker to business-woman, with 3 warehouses collecting, sorting and selling on empty plastic bottles. Her young son, who has a network of 'suppliers' (who scour rubbish tips, restaurant and shop refuse) and a rickshaw collects the bottles, and brings them back to the warehouses where 4 employees remove the labels and sort the bottles by colour. They are then bundled into huge balls weighing up to 100 kilos and sold by weight for around 50 each to the next link in the recycling chain. (Johora cheats a little here by filling the odd bottle with water to increase the weight!). At the next stage of the recycling process, some of the bottles are shredded, and the 'chips' are sold to manufacturers of poly-synthetic fibres who can use them to make everything from polar fleece to the stuffing for your sofa cushions. All of these examples encapsulate so well the ethos behind a circular economy, however the tragic part of this story is the fact that these people aren't dredging mud out of drains or collecting plastic bottles because they care about the environment, for them it a necessity for survival: \"Where you see trash, we see a livelihood\". It's time that here in the west we began to realise that 'trash' shouldn't really exist as a concept any more. Money can be made from the recycling and recovery process. What if we started collecting and selling all of our plastic bottles? What if recycling became more of a business than a chore? This illegal 'backstreet entrepreneurship' can also be seen in San Francisco, where due to the California Bottle Bill of 1987 (which means a deposit is paid on all plastic and glass bottles sold in the state) recycling has become an extremely profitable business for gangs who raid recycling bins. In February's edition of BBC 4's 'Costing the World' , Tom Heap meets a 78-year-old Vietnamese woman who has spent all night rummaging through bins to collect just 17 worth of recycling. While this illegal activity means that 78% of all waste in the city is diverted from landfill, imagine if we could make this a legitimate business model, instead of relying on those in desperate need to do the work for us, illegally. One of the main drivers for the Technology Strategy board putting up 1.25million for designers to come up with new approaches to the closed loop system are the rising cost of metals and other resources. China now own 97% of the Rare Earth market. We don't use the words 'sustainable' or 'eco' as the drivers are now financial as well as moral. One of the most interesting things to note about all of these stories is the networks that these people have. When Kaale decided to take extend his business to selling drain sludge, he knew exactly who to call who could process mud into gold. When Johora brought her own van so that she could sell her bottles on directly, she knew exactly where to take them to get the best price. It's developing these networks that we need to build on. We need to make sure that we know where to take our goods to recycle them; we need to make sure we know a materials expert to consult when designing new products and we need to make sure we are building and using these networks at every stage of a products life span. We need to become a connected society .

            "NA NE\t0002697\tToronto cycling activists were gnashing their spokes and rending their spandex after city council voted to kill the Jarvis Street bike lanes on Wednesday. Put in only last summer, the curbside lanes are to be pulled right back out again by the end of next year. It looks like a huge step backward. In fact, it could turn into a big win for cycling in the city. Almost lost in the hubbub over Jarvis was the fact that council also voted to push ahead with Toronto's first network of separated bike lanes. That means cyclists will be able to travel on lanes that are not just painted lines on the asphalt, like those on Jarvis, but fully separated from car traffic. Council voted to build separated lanes across the Bloor Viaduct, to start design work on separated lanes for Sherbourne, Wellesley, Harbord and Beverley and to look into separated lanes on Richmond and Peter or Simcoe. The result would be a system that would take cyclists smoothly and safely from, say, the Danforth to the financial district or from the University of Toronto to the waterfront without having to fight their way through mixed traffic. It is the biggest step yet toward creating a true bike network for Toronto -- not just the dog's breakfast of disconnected, unprotected lanes we have now, but a real network like they have in Montreal. Thousands of commuters who now fear to ride in the turmoil of the open road would start cycling instead of driving to work, with all the benefits that brings for health, air quality and traffic congestion Denzil Minnan-Wong (Ward 34-Don Valley East), the moderate conservative councillor behind the project, says the city is planning to spend twice as much on its bike plans over four years as former mayor David Miller did in his final four. On top of 14 kilometres of separated lanes, the city would create 100 kilometres of off-street bike trails in ravines and rail or hydro corridors. After years of slow, stuttering progress on cycling infrastructure, that would be real progress. Great, say cycling advocates -- if it ever happens (they have understandable doubts given all the talk about the city's money troubles). But if you're going to build a bike network, they say, why start by killing bike lanes on Jarvis? The answer is simple: politics. The Jarvis lanes were a red flag to motorists from the start. Jarvis is one of the few broad streets taking car commuters in and out of downtown. Removing the roadway's reversing fifth lane to make room for bikes added minutes to that painful commute. Suburban councillors with car-commuting residents denounced the bike lanes. They were doomed from the moment Mayor Rob Ford took office on a pledge to end the \"war on the car.\" Jarvis had to be sacrificed if the mayor and hostile councillors were ever going to back bike lanes elsewhere. It was an unspoken tradeoff: You can have your lost traffic lane on Jarvis back if we can take away space on other, less vital roads for bike lanes. That will strike cycling zealots as the worst kind of appeasement. In their world, cycling is so virtuous and car commuting so ruinous that making any kind of concession amounts to surrender. They are vowing to fight on to save the Jarvis lanes during the 18-month reprieve they won for the lanes at Wednesday's council meeting. But in the real world, most people still get to work by car. Telling them they are bad people won't get us anywhere. Killing Jarvis should soothe their war-on-the-car fears and ease the way for bike lanes on other roads. Jarvis had to die so bigger bike plans could be born. Now let's make sure they come to something. \n",

            "IN IB\t1480827\tLooking at the Islamic Bond (Sukuk): A Case of Legal Uncertainty? The financial markets of the Middle East (in line with much of the Western world) are currently in an economic turmoil and this has caused a number of investors in the financial sector to revisit some of the concepts of Islamic (Sharia) Law. The most important principles of Sharia Law in relation to the financial sector include- ? the prohibition of interest; ? profit and loss sharing (ie, parties must share risks and profits); ? asset-backing principle -- in each financial transaction, there must be an underlying asset. Following the recent press relating to Dubai and the Nakheel Sukuk, it is the 'legal status' of an Islamic Bonds ('Sukuk') that are under intense scrutiny. The questions that remain open are: From the jurisdictional point of view, is Sukuk to be governed by Sharia Law? If Sukuk is governed by Sharia Law, are the current Islamic Bonds that have been issued Sharia compliant? Do the bond holders have any rights to the assets? Sukuk is, in principle, a Sharia compliant bond. Conventional bonds are not Sharia compliant because they are centered around the provision of interest and do not necessarily uphold the asset-backing principle. In contrast, Sukuk upholds the prohibition of interest and asset-backing principles of Sharia Law. The transaction forming Sukuk does not involve interest and the claim embodied in Sukuk is an ownership claim, and as such, it is similar to the conventional concept of securitization. It is important to note that there is not a standard interpretation of Sharia Law with regards to Sukuk and some Islamic scholars have argued that some of the Islamic Bonds that are in circulation in the financial markets are not Sharia compliant. Therefore, this could potentially result in the bonds being unlawful and unenforceable. The issue is that some of the Islamic Bonds issued may not actually involve the transfer of assets to investors, therefore, the Bonds may well be 'asset-based', but not 'asset-backed.' Hence, such bonds will not uphold the asset-backing principle. This is a crucial issue for investors, for if the legal title of the asset has not been transferred to the investor, in the case of bankruptcy, the assets will be 'swallowed up' by 'returning' to the originators. The jurisdictional question and consequent issue of who has rights to the assets can be further complicated if the financial agreement contains a clause along the lines of 'subject to the principles of the glorious Sharia the agreement would be governed by and constructed in accordance with the laws of England.' This is the clause that was contained in agreements which were subject to court proceedings in the case of Shamil Bank of Bahrain EC v Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd (2004) EWCA Civ 19. The Court of Appeal held that the general reference in the agreements did not identify any specific aspects of Sharia Law intended to be incorporated into the contracts and so therefore, Sharia Law did not govern the agreement. In such cases, it is likely that, after looking at the intention of parties and identifying the 'commercial purpose' of the agreement, the court will deem Sharia Law inapplicable. Significant transactions involving Islamic Bonds are now in need of legal interpretation. Presently, a court case is still proceeding over the issue of whether investors in Sukuk issued by East Cameron (a US energy firm) own the assets. Furthermore, Nakheel (the property unit of Dubai World) was supposed to pay the last rental coupon and buy back its assets by 14 December 2009, but has declared that it cannot do so. We await to see to any further legal proceedings. \n",
            "NA MA\t0028689\tChelsea Flower Show through the years The Chelsea Flower Show is the jewel in the Royal Horticultural Society's crown. Held each year in May, the event attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors over its five days. A staggering 800 people spend just over three weeks building the show putting together the show gardens, nursery exhibits, floristry displays, garden product stands and educational displays. The Great Pavilion is 12000m 2 -- the same size as two football pitches with enough room to park 500 London buses. The magic began in 1804 when Sir Joseph Banks and John Wedgewood founded the Horticultural Society of London. Prince Albert, its then President, renamed the charity in 1861 as the Royal Horticultural Society and the following year the Great Spring Show was born. In 1912 the show was forced to relocate from Temple Garden to the Royal Hospital at Chelsea. The venue proved such a success that in 1913, the Chelsea Flower Show was premiered. The picture shown left shows RHS staff from the show that year. In the early years of World War I the show was still held, but was cancelled in 1917 and 1918. By the 1920s the show was back in full force with the Chelsea Flower Show as THE social setting for tea parties and royal visits. Photographs from 1930-1939 (see above) reveal that the show was a roaring success and in 1937, when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth celebrated their Coronation Year, a magnificent Empire Exhibition was staged. Unfortunately the show had to be cancelled once again during World War II, as the War Office required the land for an anti-aircraft site. When the show resumed in 1947 there was still some doubt as to whether it should take place at all. Exhibitors wanted a postponement as stocks of plants were low, staff much depleted and fuel for greenhouses was obtainable only with special permits. However, Lord Aberconway (then RHS President) and the RHS Council felt strongly that the show should resume as soon as possible. The show was a great success. In 1953 the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II caused for a flower show that reflected the celebratory mood of the country. While the majority of the royal family were able to attend, other engagements meant that unfortunately the Queen herself wasn't. The show continues to grow in strength and popularity with the 2010 Chelsea Flower Show the 88th show to be held at the Royal Hospital grounds having seen numerous changes in fashion and design over the years, and the launch of some 600 new plant species. Here's hoping that 2010 will be another winning year. Photographs copyright RHS wih thanks to RHS, Lindley Library Key dates from the RHS Chelsea Flower Show's blooming history 1862 First show held at the RHS garden in Kensington called the Royal Horticultural Society's Great Spring Show. 1888 The RHS Garden was closed and the show was moved to Temple Gardens near Embankment. 1911 The final show at Temple Gardens. 1913 The Great Spring Show is moved to the Royal Hospital grounds permanently, there after known as the Chelsea Flower Show. Japanese dwarf trees, now known as bonsai, are first exhibited. 1914-1916 Despite World War I, the show is still held. Rock garden displays prove to be particularly popular. 1917-1918 The show is cancelled. 1920s The show is back in full swing. 1926 The General Strike causes a delay of one week. 1928 Torrential flooding of the marquees due to heavy rain and hailstones the night before, but the show opens the next morning without any signs of damage. 1937 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth celebrate their Coronation Year and the Empire Exhibition is staged in their honour. 1940s The War Office needs the grounds during World War II and subsequently the show is cancelled. 1947 The show resumes and is a success despite concerns from exhibitors. 1953 The coronation of Queen Elizabeth II causes a celebratory show. Unfortunately, the Queen herself wasn't able to attend. 1959 The Times 'Garden of To-morrow', complete with radio-controlled lawn mower is debuted. 1968 Wisley exhibit hostas, which gives a great boost to their popularity. 1980s Paved back gardens and cottage gardens are in high fashion. 1988 Visitor numbers are capped at 157,000 due to huge popular demand at the show in 1987. 1997 Christopher Bradley-Hole's Latin Garden is the first garden at Chelsea to exhibit the new fashion for sparse planting. 2000 Gardens Illustrated present their own garden and win Best In Show. 2009 Top Gear presenter James May breaks the mould as he constructs a garden entirely made out of plasticine. \n"

She said that a police recruit (who has name suppression) raped her. He has just been found not guilty , after the judge told the jury to consider the credibility of the witnesses. The subtext of the defence was, she did too much drugs, she had too much sex, she couldn't tell you who attacked and raped her. The man is applying to re-enter police college - I'm not feeling any safer. 2 comments: I just stumbled onto the news about this case tonight - addressed in post, Gee, why is it women and youth in the sex trade won't trust law enforcement*? - and would be interested to know if you've heard anything new about the case. (I'm in Richmond, Virginia in the U.S., so you're obviously a lot closer to the relevant news sources here, though I've dug up some stuff online.) I understand the police recruit was found not guilty, but is still seeking to restart his police career - a notion so infuriating to me I don't know where to begin. Most maddening of all to me, though, is the fact that he gets to remain anonymous. In any event, I applaud the bravery of Jacqueline Howat for at least pursuing the charges. That had to be a rough situation. I hope she is able to recover from this travesty. Not really. This case got swamped with a more profile case (which had a better result). I imagine we won't hear anything more about it. The coverage made me so angry. Although the radio journalist coverage did a passably ok job. \"The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women. It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism, and become lesbians.\" \n",
            "NA PB\t0302026\tThe BBC will support social innovation by encouraging users' efforts to build sites and projects that meet their needs and those of their communities...This is exemplified through plans for Backstage, a public site for the BBC's in-house development teams to share development plans with their peers and audiences. In a similar way to Google's Labs test-site, this will be a place to demonstrate work in progress, share expertise and invite contributions and collaboration with expert users. The BBC will also be committed to using open standards that will enable users to find and repurpose BBC content in more flexible ways It was a laudable aim, and the site launched with some prototypes built by internal people who had been given early access to some of the feeds. I contributed two efforts. \"Where is the BBC News?\" crudely parsed news headlines for country names, and made the countries currently being mentioned light up on a map, and the BBC Complaints RSS feed, which as I mentioned yesterday , was an effort at screen-scraping to produce content in a format that the BBC should have been publishing anyway. The public launch was at Open Tech 2005 , where it understandably over-shadowed my simultaneous talk on \" Putting a F__k Off Dalek on the BBC Homepage isn't big or clever \" \"It's one of the quirkier products of the BBC's new Backstage project, where people with enormous brains, mad haircuts and pale complexions do extraordinary, innovative and often frightening things with our content.\" As I said back in 2005 though, I was pleased that the yay-sayers overcame the nay-sayers to launch Backstage, which really was quite a shock to some of the closed 'old media' thinking within the BBC at the time. I'm glad that I got a chance to work with people like Ben Metcalfe , Matt Cashmore , Ian Forrester and Rain Ashford , and I wish Ian and Rain all the best with what they go on to do next.

            "NA PB\t0427884\tWelcome I am a process artist, a teacher and a facilitator of social technologies for face to face conversation in the service of emergence. My business is supporting invitation: the invitation to collaborate, to organize, to find one another and make a difference in our communities, organizations and lives. In a changing and complex world, there are no answers, there is no certainty. Leadership and questions are everywhere. We are called to be in active engagement with the world around us, to make sense of things we are seeing and to act on our visions and ideas for the good and benefit of all. The fundamental human capacities of this era are among the most ancient: invitation and conversation. When we invite people to work with us, whoever shows up are the right people. When we live a life of invitation, our work becomes about making connections to make things happen. And once we have a group of people acting on an invitation, deep and meaningful conversation becomes the way we collaborate sustainably together to co-create the world we want. I work with organizations seeking to improve their work, communities seeking to improve their future, people looking to improve their lives. I hold and care for process -- the ways in which we work together -- to encourage people to make their best possible contributions. I have an unflagging belief that the answers and leadership we need arise out of collaboration and conversation. By facilitating skillful dialogue, I do my best to hold space for futures to emerge. \n",
            "NA PB\t1762533\tFeeling Good. Feeling Bad. And learning to spot the difference. It's an incredibly subtle and delicate business. Trying to detect and quantify the daily changes in my mental and physical condition. As I've observed before, the first big lesson to learn is that cancer is, by and large, a slow, drawn out affair. Nothing happens over-night. At least if it does, it's such an incremental change that it's easy to overlook. I also have to filter the data, search through the background static of everyday common-or-garden fifty year old pathology and neurosis -- the aching bones, headaches and oral decay, to try and spot any meaningful trends. It's like panning for gold, only less rewarding. So the only useful way to answer that question, is to compare how I am feeling today, not with yesterday, but with a month ago. Or three months ago. Are there any patterns to be detected, or trends to discover? Well let's see. Looking at photos from last spring, I don't look much different. My weight is about the same, if anything I've gained a few pounds over Christmas and the new year. Also on the up side, many of the accumulated years of worry lines and wrinkles seem to have smoothed themselves out, I can only put this down to my premature release from the advertising mad-house. Against all the predictions, after three rounds of chemo I seem to have held onto most of my hair, It's a bit thinner, and a little greyer, but still hanging on to my skull tenaciously. My head, arms and legs are tanned brown from the sun and wind, the rest of my carcass is still official United Kingdom white, and untidily punctuated with random moles and freckles. In the middle of my mostly hairless chest however, is a patchy brown rectangle about the size of a paperback book. There is a corresponding blemish in the middle of my back just under my shoulder-blades. They are souvenirs from the radiation treatment I enjoyed back in November. I have no idea if they are permanent but I consider them something of a badge of honor A couple of inches bellow my right collar bone is a pronounced bump about the size of a two dollar coin. (that's 50p to you limeys), which is the site of my porta-cath. This is the filler-cap where I take delivery of my chemo drugs. As the surgeon who installed it for me promised, this has been largely forgotten about now, I'm really only reminded of its presence when I'm wearing my shoulder bag, or a car seatbelt, although Jo tells me I play with it absent-mindedly when I'm watching TV. So, externally at least. No real changes to report. Jo reckons I turn yellow during the middle week of each cycle, but she's the only one to have mentioned it -- probably everyone else is to polite. Internally who know's what is going on. Apart from the intermittent nausea and light-headedness brought on by my the various drugs, I feel mostly normal. I can't 'feel' my cancer. I thought I could in the early days, but that's gone now. What does a tumor or a lymph node feel like anyway? Oh! Tinitus. I almost forgot. This is a new one. A high pitched ringing in my ears. Not all the time, just intermittently. How a drug that is supposed to kill cancer cells in your stomach can make your ears ring is completely beyond me. But there you go. Apparently it's not a big deal. Unless it becomes constant and permanent, in which case it will be a very big deal. The thing I'm watching most closely is my energy levels. This seems as good a marker as any for my overall condition. I'm not sure if these are improving, or if I'm just getting used to operating on a lower power setting. For the first one or two cycles, I did find myself retiring to the bedroom for a little mid-afternnon siesta most days, particularly in the middle and last week of the three week cycle. This time 'round I've done this less, and coped pretty well, although after a couple of active days, I often feel the need to have a sedentary day to recover. Across the street from our house is a reserve, and along the side of it a leafy, overgrown footpath used by the locals as a short-cut to the village. We probably walk up and down this path at least once a day, and often more. It's a steep hill down to the village, and a fair pull back up to the cottage. This is my personal fitness gauge. not very scientific granted, but a good indicator of how I'm doing. Some days I can breeze up the grassy incline without even getting out of breath (with forty-a-day Jo bringing up the rear). on other days, my legs are burning, and I'm sweating and gasping for air by the time I get to the top. Weird. Since before Christmas I've had a niggling low level infection. Ear ache. Tooth ache. Sore throat. Dry cough. My voice is broken and croaky, and sometimes gives out altogether. It comes and goes, but never clears up entirely. It's annoying rather than debilitating, and is almost certainly down to my low immunity levels, brought on by a low white blood cell count. I had my fourth chemo cycle, due to start last Wednesday deferred for a week to allow my 'bloods' to recover, but I have a feeling this is something I'm just going to have to put up with for the duration of my treatment. Compared with some of the horrors many of my fellow travellers have to endure, this is just a minor irritation and I'm really not complaining. So how am I feeling? Well, down but not out. Mentally I'm feeling strong and positive. Physically, a bit depleted but nothing like as bad as I was expecting, and I get the feeling that even the doctors are quietly impressed, although they don't give much away. Most of them would make excellent poker players. The chemo clearly has a a slow but insidious cumulative effect, and my job is to try and stay on top of things for another three cycles -- possibly more. Chemo kills cancer. The more of it I can stand, the better my chances are.

Plus I allowed myself the luxury of unplugging from the Matrix while on holiday. Glad to see you're still in the ring with your gloves up. Actually I think your mother is right; you should turn this into a book. I've never met you or heard of you until now. I don't work in advertising and i'm not a cancer survivor but I stumbled upon your blog via a link on a friend's facebook page and now i'm hooked. Your story appeals to me not because it's a story about dying but because it's a story about living; what it means to be alive. It has made me question what's important, and what's not, what to reflect on in life and what to let go of. As someone who has suffered with depression my whole life, I find your posts and views on life uplifting and inspiring. You have made me laugh and cry. \n",

            "NA PB\t3193856\tI have followed the recent controversy at my alma mater, Sacred Heart Academy, with keen interest. I have passionate feelings about the decision not to let Dominic Sheahan speak at the 2012 graduation ceremonies, but for many, those opinions would distract from the point of this commentary. I wouldn't want to do that. While I have empathy for everyone caught in this crossfire, my prayers and emotional connection have largely been with a man who I am quite certain has been saddened and hurt by events of the last month, Dominic's grandpa, Jerry Sheahan. Jerry Sheahan is one of the most pivotal figures in my blessed life. I have never publicly told him that. In this very difficult month for Jerry, and before either of us pass; it strikes me as important to tell him and the world. I also think the tale carries larger lessons for all of us. I was born in Mt. Pleasant in 1949 with Arthrogriposis Multicongenita, a congenital birth defect that deformed my limbs. I required braces and almost annual surgeries. One spring day in 1956 Jerry Sheahan called my dad, Jim McGuire, and asked if Tim could be batboy for Sheahan's highly successful Little League baseball team. Sheahan and his co-coach (the late) Bob Wohlscheid were both parishioners at Sacred Heart. They had known my parents, Jim and Anita, for years. Without much notice, a uniform appeared at the house and that evening I was in the Roosevelt Oil team's dugout. I arrived at the West Side stadium that night more than a little confused. Jerry briefed me on my duties and I tentatively followed his instructions. I vaguely knew only a couple of the players. The game had barely begun when a photographer from the local newspaper, the Mt Pleasant Daily Times-News, showed up at the game. The photographer took one picture of my back looking onto the field. My omnipresent braces are prominent in the photo. The second picture the paper published showed me handing a bat to a player well more than a head taller than me (Joe Feldman) and the caption said I told him to hit a homerun. Both captions took considerable liberties describing me as a \"gallant sparkplug' and decreeing I \"handled the bats like diamonds.\" At the time I was no gallant sparkplug and I don't think I had the good sense to tell anyone to hit a home run. There would come a day, however, when I did handle those bats like diamonds and all those characterizations would become more or less true. Roosevelt Oil (later Leonard Refinery) and Little League became an integral part of my springs and summers for the next five years. Usually the season was close to complete by the time I headed for my annual summer surgeries and casts. I still remember minute details of games, seasons and players. If the players regarded me as an oddity I never felt it for a moment. My sense of team and self-esteem was as strong as the fastball of the star pitcher, John Schade. I fondly remember team picnics at amusement parks and other team outings. I was always front and center in team photos and celebrations. To this day, my good friend Mick Natzel, talks about when we \"played\" Little League together. Sheahan and Wohlscheid accomplished their probable goal. The sports-crazed little kid who would never play baseball felt like he belonged to a team. I never felt like the lonely, handicapped boy. Sheahan, Wohlscheid and the players made me feel as if I had a real role with a championship team. These days I read a lot about the dramatic increase of shameful bullying in schools. It angers me and saddens me that some youngsters are harassed to the point of suicide. News stories like that make me reflect on two things. First, I reflect on the two young girls I remember in school that were unmercifully teased. Every time I read one of those stories I have a major pang of regret that I never helped them. Yet, I know why I didn't. I was just so bloomin' grateful that I wasn't the one the other kids were teasing. That's when I marvel at how little I was picked on as a young kid even though I \"walked funny.\" I am convinced much of that was due to my young friends in the community. Practically every kid under 12 knew the batboy for Roosevelt Oil and they knew his team liked him. With the frequent help of my young friends from my Little League team, Mike Hackett, Bill McDonald and my brother Marty I survived those prepubescent years in fine shape. I knew there were always people there to help me. Jerry Sheahan and Bob Wohlscheid with one big act of kindness offered me a hand up. It changed my young life. I salute Jerry and Bob and I salute all my friends who saved me from bullying. At the same time I wonder if there is a youngster each of us could save from bullying by caring as much as Jerry and Bob did. And, I wonder if we're coaching our kids enough to stand up for those youngsters around them who are getting the short end of the stick. Tim McGuire is a Mt Pleasant native who retired as Editor of The Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2002. He is now The Frank Russell Chair for the Business of Journalism at The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University . \n",

Now, I'm a bit shamefaced to admit this, being an English teacher, but the one I'm least likely to score any unwikied points on is Graham Greene, despite the fact that I did once meet him while I was at university.

I've never read any of his stuff, but then I'm sure that he never read any of mine either. Enough of such pointless chaff.

            "NA PB SS\t3027643\tI heard distant booming. Was it the sound of bombs or bitterns, warfare or ornithology? I decided I had to find out, for there was a great deal of difference between the two, as I am sure you realise. If it was the boom of exploding bombs, and war had been declared, then it was no comfort to me that the booms were distant. Today they might be, but I was in no doubt that the marauding and rapacious foe, having bombed land far away, would advance, and bomb ever closer to the agreeable faubourg where I lived, until they bombed my own neighbourhood, and me in it, unless I fled. Paradoxically, perhaps, before making the decision to flee I would have to do the opposite, to approach the distant booms, to discover if they were indeed the booms of bombs. If, on the other hand, the booms were the booms of bitterns, I would have no need to flee. I could return happily to my faubourg without a care in the world. If anything, I would be happier than before, having learned of the presence of bitterns, albeit distant bitterns. If there were bitterns, I reasoned, there would be a lake, or a similar body of water. There are few things I like better than to go plashing about up to my knees in a lake, plunging my hands into the water now and again with scarcely credible rapidity, to pluck out a fish for my dinner. It is a skill I learned at my mother's knee. She had studied the sudden darting movements of certain insects, and learned through long hard practice to imitate them. All I had to do, with equally long hard practice, was to imitate her. Surely, you might ask, given my predilections I would know of the existence of a lake, albeit a distant one? It is a reasonable question. All I can say by way of explanation is that I had never before heard booms, booms that might be those of bitterns, from that direction, north-west, by the way. To which I would add that there has been a flurry of artificial lake and pond construction all across the land of late. The king is keen on bodies of water, and dreams of a land riddled with them. Some have joshed that if he gets his way there will be more water than land, just little ribbons and eyots dotted higgledy-piggledy in a great network of ponds and lakes connected by canals. But the king is also a bellicose fellow with a seething hatred of . . . oh, you name it! His list of hatreds is long, and it includes the neighbouring lands, their kings and queens and armies and civilian populations. So it would be no surprise if the booms I heard were the booms of bombs. The king might well have declared war, almost as an afterthought or aside, or one of his shouty declamations from his balcony could have led a neighbour to declare war on him, which, by extension, means us, and me. Given the king's twin obsessions, I judged that the probability of the booms being bombs or bitterns was about fifty-fifty. That was in the absence of any other information. My faubourg is quite an isolated one, and we are often the last to hear any news of national import. Last time there was a war, for example, we only found out about it when there were pitched battles in the streets between our side and the marauding and rapacious foe. That foe had not made use of bombs. They were somewhat primitive barbarians armed with cutlasses and catapults. Nor do we tend to get news of the king's latest lake-creation schemes. Generally what happens is that the plans are made in his chamber, by him alone, and then the bulldozers move in and villages are destroyed and a huge pit dug into which unimaginable gallons of water are poured. Fish and birds follow, drawn by nature. Over the next week or so, I made preparations for my journey. I put my faubourg affairs in order as best I could, and prepared an enormous number of sandwiches. These I wrapped in greaseproof paper. I bought, at a discount, several multipacks of Squelcho!. I patched the odd hole in my knitwear, and had my hiking boots renovated by the best hiking boot renovator in the faubourg. I mention these things to demonstrate that I was serious in my endeavour, not a mere flibbertigibbet disconcerted by distant booms. All the while, I could not help noticing that these distant booms were growing louder and thus, I reasoned, closer. This would tend to tip the balance in favour of the booming of bombs, but there was no knowing the level of fanaticism to which the king might take his body of water building activities, so there was still a fair chance that the booming was the booming of bitterns. There came a day when I had nearly finished putting my affairs in order and had packed most of my supplies. By now the booms were so loud, and so close, that I began to doubt I would need to go investigating at all. So unlikely, now, was the prospect of my journey that I tucked in to several of the sandwiches and drank two cans of Squelcho!. No sooner had I shoved the crumpled greaseproof paper and the crushed cans down my waste chute, than a bomb crashed through the ceiling. It landed on my rug, and made a ticking noise. I reasoned that I had mere seconds to dash as far away as possible before it exploded with a boom. At least, I thought, I now know the provenance of the booms. But as I made for the front door, ready to scarper, my ears were assailed by a deafening boom. Dizzy with panic, I pirouetted round and round like a man who has lost his senses. I was utterly befuddled that my chalet still stood, solid and safe and agreeable apart from the gaping hole in the ceiling. And then, as I peered out into the front garden, I saw a flock of bitterns had come to land next to my garden puddle, and they were booming, booming, booming. \n"
