Tips
That
Will
Hook
You
Bigger
Fish
!
Tip
!
Boat
fishing
will
allow
you
to
gain
access
to
lots
of
different
fishing
locations
,
but
it
is
more
dangerous
.
When
you
are
fishing
from
a
boat
,
always
be
mindful
of
safety
.
Have
you
often
declined
invitations
to
go
fishing
because
you
were
n't
sure
whether
you
really
wanted
to
fish
?
Fishing
is
a
great
way
for
people
to
enjoy
themselves
,
so
use
the
following
tips
to
make
sure
your
day
on
the
water
is
both
profitable
and
enjoyable
.
Tip
!
Fish
responsibly
.
Be
careful
of
the
environment
while
fishing
;
do
n't
do
anything
that
could
harm
it
.
If
for
you
smoking
and
fishing
go
hand
-
in
-
hand
,
be
careful
when
fishing
from
a
shoreline
.
Make
people
use
cancer
sticks
during
fishing
trips
.
If
you
're
one
of
them
,
make
sure
the
embers
of
your
cigarette
do
n't
inadvertently
light
leaves
or
grass
on
fire
.
The
bank
itself
may
be
wet
,
but
the
surrounding
foliage
is
often
quick
to
catch
on
fire
.
Tip
!
Fishermen
should
carry
a
scale
as
part
of
their
gear
.
If
you
prefer
to
release
fish
after
they
are
caught
,
you
should
be
able
to
weigh
them
beforehand
.
Just
as
hunters
wear
clothing
that
helps
them
blend
into
the
surrounding
terrain
,
so
should
fishermen
.
Although
fish
can
n't
see
well
,
a
bright
shirt
could
easily
spook
them
.
It
is
best
to
wear
earth
tones
.
Tip
!
Figure
out
what
time
the
fish
you
are
after
are
most
active
.
Most
fish
are
I
ve
in
the
early
hours
and
late
evening
hours
.
It
is
important
to
respect
the
environment
when
you
are
engaged
in
any
outdoor
activity
.
Keep
in
mind
that
nature
belongs
to
animals
and
humans
alike
.
Try
doing
your
part
so
you
do
n't
disrupt
nature
.
Surf
Fishing
Tip
!
When
you
fish
you
want
to
make
sure
you
do
n't
litter
.
Fish
will
avoid
areas
that
are
littered
with
debris
and
garbage
.
Have
you
ever
tried
surf
fishing
?
Surf
fishing
is
a
favorite
pastime
,
and
you
have
a
variety
of
fish
to
catch
in
the
summer
months
.
Many
people
enjoy
wading
into
the
water
and
catching
skinny
water
fish
.
These
fish
are
most
attracted
to
shrimp
,
minnow
,
or
artificial
bait
.
Tip
!
The
day
before
you
go
fishing
,
fatten
up
your
I
ve
bait
so
that
it
looks
better
to
the
fish
and
does
not
take
as
much
time
to
get
on
the
hook
.
Use
a
flat
container
lined
with
newspaper
to
store
the
worms
,
and
place
it
in
the
refrigerator
overnight
.
Look
for
areas
of
deep
water
.
Check
into
areas
that
have
the
deepest
water
when
you
are
river
fishing
.
Fish
will
congregate
in
areas
like
these
,
particularly
in
warm
weather
.
Another
good
place
to
look
for
them
is
around
big
rocks
and
under
rock
overhangs
.
Once
you
find
a
great
spot
in
the
river
,
remember
exactly
where
it
is
for
future
reference
.
Tip
!
If
you
have
to
make
use
of
a
net
when
catching
fish
,
make
sure
that
it
enters
headfirst
.
This
makes
it
so
that
the
fish
will
n't
move
as
much
,
thus
,
giving
it
a
lesser
chance
of
escaping
.
If
you
want
to
catch
larger
fish
,
try
moving
to
bigger
lures
or
larger
amounts
of
bait
.
It
may
seem
obvious
to
the
experienced
fisherman
to
use
a
larger
bait
,
however
,
it
may
be
overlooked
by
the
casual
fisherman
.
Bigger
fish
tend
to
be
much
more
interested
in
bigger
bait
.
Larger
lures
and
baits
also
discourage
smaller
fish
from
approaching
your
hook
,
so
that
you
can
concentrate
your
time
on
landing
the
really
big
catches
.
Tip
!
When
photographing
your
catch
,
make
every
effort
to
return
the
fish
to
the
water
as
quickly
as
possible
.
Each
minute
that
the
fish
is
kept
dry
makes
it
less
likely
to
survive
.
As
a
fisherman
,
you
should
learn
the
proper
way
to
clean
fish
.
All
you
need
is
a
small
,
sharp
knife
and
a
table
to
cut
on
.
Slice
down
the
belly
,
starting
at
the
head
and
moving
down
to
the
tail
.
Sever
the
head
,
then
pull
on
it
as
you
pull
the
organs
in
an
opposite
direction
.
The
result
will
be
an
open
and
clean
fish
.
Tip
!
Bring
aspirin
with
you
when
you
are
on
a
boat
for
a
long
period
of
time
.
While
fishing
,
you
may
feel
drowsy
or
nauseous
,
and
aspirin
can
help
.
Try
your
very
best
to
get
the
fish
's
head
if
you
really
have
to
net
your
fish
in
order
to
get
it
.
This
will
stress
the
fish
less
and
cause
less
damage
to
its
fins
.
Cradle
the
net
using
both
hands
,
as
this
reduces
the
chance
that
a
fighting
fish
will
make
it
back
into
the
water
.
Tip
!
Do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
to
dispose
of
dead
minnows
.
Your
bait
might
be
dead
,
but
that
does
n't
mean
it
's
useless
.
There
does
not
exist
any
perfect
bait
that
can
attract
all
fish
,
all
the
time
.
To
get
the
best
results
,
know
when
and
how
to
properly
use
a
grub
,
jig
or
worm
.
In
murky
water
jigs
generally
do
better
because
of
the
motion
that
they
produce
.
This
motion
help
catch
the
fish
's
eye
.
On
the
other
hand
,
a
plastic
worm
works
well
in
water
that
is
clear
,
since
you
will
not
have
the
need
to
use
too
much
noticeable
motion
.
Tip
!
Be
sure
that
you
look
at
the
weather
forecast
prior
to
fishing
.
You
might
find
that
the
weather
is
going
to
make
it
difficult
to
catch
anything
.
Being
a
good
fisherman
involves
many
different
things
,
including
using
the
right
equipment
,
fishing
at
the
best
spots
and
learning
about
the
different
types
of
fish
.
Fishing
can
be
simple
or
complex
and
appeals
to
a
broad
range
of
people
.
Remember
what
you
read
in
this
article
the
next
time
you
go
fishing
,
and
you
should
be
more
successful
.
From
the
time
Jennifer
was
a
little
child
,
she
was
demanding
of
attention
,
especially
from
her
mother
,
Sarah
.
With
two
older
brothers
,
Jennifer
had
a
?
special
"
place
in
the
family
as
the
baby
and
the
only
girl
.
She
made
sure
to
establish
a
?
special
"
relationship
with
her
mother
,
who
he
d
the
connection
since
she
did
nt
have
much
of
a
relationship
with
her
emotionally
distant
husband
.
It
was
easy
for
Jennifer
to
control
her
mother?s
attention
.
Because
her
mother
was
needy
for
emotional
connection
and
afraid
of
not
being
liked
,
all
Jennifer
had
to
do
was
get
angry
at
her
mother
and
Sarah
would
capitulate
,
giving
Jennifer
the
attention
she
craved
.
Jennifer
learned
early
to
control
her
mother
by
becoming
angry
,
critical
and
withholding
love
when
her
mother
did
nt
do
what
she
wanted
.
Unwittingly
,
Sarah
contributed
to
Jennifer?s
neediness
,
entitlement
issues
,
and
the
belief
that
happiness
was
dependent
on
approval
and
attention
from
others
.
Jennifer
,
now
in
her
late
30?s
,
finds
herself
continuing
the
pattern
she
started
with
her
mother
attaching
to
others
in
needy
and
demanding
ways
.
The
result
is
she
has
not
been
able
to
have
a
successful
relationship
with
any
of
the
men
she
has
dated
.
We
all
have
a
need
to
feel
special
.
It
is
not
the
need
that
is
dysfunctional
,
it
is
how
we
go
about
getting
the
need
met
that
can
be
either
dysfunctional
or
healthy
.
It
is
dysfunctional
when
we
make
others
responsible
for
making
us
feel
special
.
When
others
have
to
I
ve
us
attention
,
compliment
us
,
seek
us
out
,
and
attend
to
our
wants
and
needs
in
order
for
us
to
feel
special
,
our
behavior
is
dysfunctional
.
Healthy
Special
-
ness
You
will
stop
pulling
on
others
to
make
you
special
only
when
you
accept
the
full
responsibility
of
making
yourself
feel
special
.
This
means
learning
to
I
ve
yourself
all
that
you
may
be
trying
to
get
from
others
?
treating
yourself
in
the
loving
ways
you
desire
from
others
.
There
are
many
ways
of
making
ourselves
feel
special
.
Instead
of
trying
to
get
others
to
I
ve
you
what
you
want
,
you
can
:
Take
Emotional
Responsibility
:
Attend
to
your
feelings
throughout
the
day
and
explore
what
you
may
be
doing
that
is
causing
painful
feelings
,
rather
than
making
others
responsible
for
your
feelings
.
Attend
to
your
own
needs
rather
than
expecting
others
to
meet
your
needs
.
Make
sure
you
are
financially
independent
rather
than
dependent
upon
another
,
if
physically
able
to
do
so
.
Spend
within
your
means
to
avoid
the
fear
and
stress
of
debt
.
Take
Relationship
Responsibility
:
Stand
up
for
yourself
and
speak
your
truth
rather
than
complying
,
defending
or
resisting
in
the
face
of
others
?
demands
or
criticism
.
do
nt
be
a
victim
.
Refrain
from
blaming
others
,
with
anger
and
criticism
,
for
your
feelings
and
behavior
.
do
nt
be
a
victim
.
Take
Organizational
Responsibility
:
Do
what
you
say
you
are
going
to
do
regarding
time
and
chores
.
Make
sure
your
living
space
and
work
environment
are
clean
and
tidy
,
and
esthetically
pleasing
.
Take
Spiritual
Responsibility
:
Take
the
time
to
connect
with
the
love
and
truth
of
God
Power
.
Take
time
throughout
the
day
to
bring
the
love
down
to
the
level
of
your
feeling
self
?
your
Inner
Child
.
Treating
yourself
in
these
loving
ways
will
eventually
result
in
feeling
internally
special
rather
than
needing
others
to
make
you
feel
special
.
As
Jennifer
practiced
making
herself
special
,
she
discovered
that
her
relationships
with
others
were
becoming
stronger
and
more
fulfilling
.
People
were
no
longer
pulling
away
from
her
,
resisting
her
,
or
defending
themselves
against
her
demands
for
attention
.
Her
behavior
naturally
and
gradually
changed
with
others
when
she
was
treat
herself
as
a
special
person
.

Pinterest
for
Business
-
what
Do
You
Pin
?
Pinterest
is
a
very
common
social
media
platform
given
that
it
is
image
rich
.
Much
like
Instagram
,
Pinterest
took
off
with
nothing
to
hold
it
back
and
there
are
claims
that
the
platform
itself
can
I
ve
more
traffic
to
your
website
than
Youtube
,
Google
+
and
Linkedin
-
combined
(
just
Googling
it
will
bring
up
many
blog
posts
)
.
Since
the
social
platform
engages
your
sense
of
sight
,
it
is
important
that
the
images
or
videos
(
yes
,
you
can
pin
videos
!
)
pinned
are
eye
catching
enough
to
stand
out
amongst
all
the
other
pins
.
So
the
million
dollar
question
is
-
what
do
you
pin
?
Many
ecommerce
retailers
only
pin
images
of
their
products
to
their
boards
.
This
is
the
most
basic
form
of
pinning
and
is
not
really
a
strategy
-
you
are
just
uploading
photos
to
another
cloud
based
server
.
Do
n't
get
me
wrong
,
pinning
images
of
your
products
is
going
to
help
you
sell
more
products
without
a
doubt
,
but
your
consumers
are
n't
always
on
the
look
out
for
more
things
to
buy
.
The
reason
why
they
will
buy
from
you
goes
much
deeper
.
Why
Does
Your
Business
Exist
?
Unless
your
product
is
a
premium
luxury
item
,
then
chances
are
there
will
n't
be
much
differentiating
your
brand
and
anothers
-
not
just
by
the
image
pinned
anyway
!
So
how
are
you
going
to
attract
the
attention
of
others
and
keep
them
glued
to
your
pin
boards
?
Ask
yourself
this
-
what
does
your
company
I
m
to
do
?
What
is
your
reason
or
purpose
?
Why
do
you
even
exist
?
This
is
The
number
1
question
you
must
answer
before
you
can
pin
anything
else
!
Why
is
this
so
important
?
Because
people
will
follow
your
brand
and
the
images
you
pin
if
they
can
relate
to
the
images
on
a
level
deeper
than
just
a
physical
item
.
Depending
on
why
your
brand
exists
,
these
images
could
add
value
to
your
followers
on
Pinterest
Is
the
purpose
of
your
brand
to
inspire
people
to
get
fit
?
If
so
then
images
of
a
body
builder
with
1
prosthetic
leg
might
inspire
someone
to
believe
what
is
possible
and
thus
exercise
.
Is
the
purpose
of
your
brand
to
spread
happiness
?
If
so
then
images
of
people
laughing
and
enjoying
themselves
might
also
put
a
smile
on
another
face
.
Once
you
have
decided
what
your
brand
purpose
is
then
you
will
know
what
type
of
images
you
should
be
pinning
.
People
will
follow
your
pins
and
boards
if
your
brand
represents
them
,
you
become
their
source
of
value
add
,
their
thought
leader
,
their
brand
.
A
really
good
example
of
how
this
is
put
into
practice
is
the
pinterest
boards
of
Lorna
Jane
-
they
have
16
boards
,
and
only
1
of
them
relates
to
their
products
.
The
rest
are
inspirations
and
'
feel
good
'
boards
.
So
now
that
you
know
what
type
of
images
you
should
be
uploading
,
it
's
still
important
to
optimise
your
images
so
that
a
follower
is
presented
with
the
best
information
you
want
them
to
see
.
We
've
mentioned
some
of
this
before
in
a
previous
post
so
do
n't
forget
to
implement
them
!
What
do
you
think
your
brand
purpose
or
mission
is
?
Why
do
you
exist
?
What
images
will
you
be
pinning
that
adheres
to
your
purpose
?

Ten
tips
to
save
your
life
(
or
at
least
prolong
it
)
If
you
could
do
just
one
thing
to
improve
your
health
,
what
should
it
be
?
That
's
the
question
we
asked
10
medical
experts
.
From
taking
up
a
new
hobby
to
cleaning
your
house
with
vinegar
,
they
came
up
with
some
surprising
suggestions
.
.
.
These
days
even
the
most
diligent
health
enthusiasts
must
surely
be
struggling
to
keep
up
with
the
latest
cure
-
all
advice
.
Recently
,
for
instance
,
we
have
been
told
to
consume
daily
portions
of
Brazilian
acai
berries
to
avoid
cancer
,
to
eat
salmon
six
times
a
week
in
order

Our
knowledge
about
what
works
well
in
online
teaching
and
learning
is
growing
rapidly
and
that
is
very
good
news
.
Yet
it
also
means
that
it
is
easy
to
feel
overwhelmed
.
Here
are
ten
best
practices
for
anyone
just
getting
started
in
the
online
environment
.
Research
and
experience
suggest
that
these
practices
contribute
to
an
effective
,
efficient
and
satisfying
teaching
and
learning
experience
for
both
faculty
and
students
.
Using
these
practices
can
help
develop
confidence
,
comfort
,
and
experience
in
teaching
online
.
Best
Practice
1
:
Be
Present
at
the
Course
Site
Liberal
use
of
a
faculty
's
use
of
communication
tools
such
as
announcements
,
discussion
board
postings
,
and
forums
communicate
to
the
students
that
the
faculty
member
cares
about
who
they
are
,
cares
about
their
questions
and
concerns
,
and
is
generally
"
present
"
to
do
the
mentoring
and
challenging
that
teaching
is
all
about
.
When
faculty
actively
interact
and
engage
students
in
a
face
-
to
-
face
classroom
,
the
class
develops
as
a
learning
community
,
developing
intellectual
and
personal
bonds
.
The
same
type
of
bonding
happens
in
an
online
setting
.
We
have
learned
to
quantify
what
it
means
to
"
be
present
.
"
The
"
best
online
"
faculty
according
to
students
are
faculty
who
show
their
presence
multiple
times
a
week
,
and
at
best
,
daily
.
Setting
clear
expectations
as
to
when
you
will
be
present
and
when
you
will
not
at
the
beginning
of
a
course
with
course
policies
is
very
helpful
,
however
,
and
can
reduce
the
need
for
daily
presence
if
that
is
not
your
particular
style
.
Setting
regular
times
when
you
can
meet
in
a
virtual
classroom
or
be
available
by
email
or
texting
,
and
thus
be
available
almost
in
real
time
similar
to
office
hours
,
can
be
invaluable
.
Note
:
Students
who
feel
abandoned
or
who
feel
alone
may
even
post
questions
,
such
as
"
is
anybody
there
?
"
This
is
a
very
clear
and
unambiguous
signal
that
not
all
is
well
.
Best
Practice
2
:
Create
a
I
ve
online
course
community
A
good
strategy
for
developing
a
I
ve
online
course
community
is
to
design
a
course
with
a
balanced
set
of
dialogues
.
This
means
designing
a
course
so
that
the
three
dialogues
of
faculty
to
student
,
student
to
student
and
student
to
resource
are
about
equal
.
In
most
online
courses
,
the
dialogue
of
faculty
to
student
is
provided
with
(
1
)
mini
-
lectures
in
text
or
video
or
audio
podcasts
,
(
2
)
weekly
coaching
and
reminder
announcements
and
(
3
)
explanations
with
the
students
.
Here
are
three
strategies
that
can
be
used
to
encourage
peer
-
to
-
peer
,
student
-
to
-
student
engagement
and
thus
the
building
of
a
course
community
.
Note
that
an
online
instructor
wants
to
develop
three
types
of
presence:social
presence
,
teaching
presence
,
and
cognitive
presence
.
Launch
the
class
with
a
personal
introduction
posting
so
that
students
can
get
to
know
one
another
and
you
get
to
know
"
where
students
'
heads
are
.
"
The
types
of
info
often
shared
by
faculty
and
students
include
info
on
professional
experiences
,
personal
information
such
as
family
and
a
photograph
.
Faculty
also
often
include
a
note
about
their
teaching
philosophy
and
research
projects
.
Encourage
use
of
a
general
open
student
forum
for
students
to
post
and
request
help
and
assistance
from
each
other
through
the
various
student
-
to
-
student
tools
,
such
as
discussions
,
help
areas
,
etc
.
Set
up
small
groups
where
students
can
assume
responsibility
for
I
ve
mentoring
of
fellow
students
and
summarizing
key
points
of
a
class
assignment
.
The
students
might
work
in
groups
of
2
,
3
or
4
.
This
strategy
is
similar
to
a
study
group
.
Set
up
problem
-
solving
forums
or
discussions
boards
,
and
assign
students
or
student
teams
to
monitor
and
support
or
direct
questions
.
Note
:
Learning
within
the
setting
of
an
online
course
community
will
work
better
for
some
students
than
for
others
.
Some
students
may
choose
not
to
participate
very
actively
at
all
;
other
students
find
it
is
the
best
way
for
them
to
learn
in
an
online
setting
.
The
point
of
this
is
that
for
those
students
who
need
it
,
it
is
an
essential
part
of
how
they
learn
.
Vygotsky
's
theories
remind
us
that
we
learn
as
social
beings
within
a
social
context
.
The
online
community
is
part
of
what
makes
this
happen
for
some
students
.
Best
Practice
3
:
Share
a
set
of
very
clear
expectations
for
your
students
and
for
yourself
as
to
(
1
)
how
you
will
communicate
and
(
2
)
how
much
time
students
should
be
working
on
the
course
each
week
This
best
practice
cannot
be
overemphasized
.
Include
on
your
course
site
a
set
of
expectations
for
how
students
communicate
and
dialogue
online
and
how
they
communicate
with
you
.
For
example
,
many
faculty
tell
students
that
they
can
expect
a
response
within
24
hours
during
the
week
.
Often
before
a
major
test
or
assignment
,
faculty
will
agree
to
hold
special
office
hours
by
computer
,
being
available
either
by
I
ve
classroom
or
email
,
or
phone
.
In
the
interests
of
time
and
community
,
it
is
best
to
use
a
tool
where
responses
and
content
can
be
shared
with
everyone
and
archived
for
flexibility
in
access
and
review
.
This
basic
expectation
of
response
time
can
easily
be
modified
so
long
as
the
change
is
communicated
to
the
students
.
It
is
easy
to
know
what
to
do
,
if
we
think
about
the
students
as
family
for
the
term
.
Students
are
very
accepting
of
a
faculty
member
's
time
and
life
requirements
if
they
know
what
is
going
on
.
And
students
often
step
in
and
help
each
other
even
more
when
they
know
a
faculty
member
is
sick
,
traveling
or
otherwise
not
available
.
Often
students
can
agree
to
monitor
course
questions
posted
in
the
Open
Forum
or
in
the
discussion
boards
for
a
week
for
example
.
Online
learning
is
just
as
I
ve
as
learning
face
-
to
-
face
,
and
time
to
do
the
work
needs
to
be
scheduled
and
planned
for
,
just
as
if
one
were
attending
face
-
to
-
face
classes
.
Being
clear
as
to
how
much
effort
and
time
will
be
required
on
a
weekly
basis
keeps
surprises
to
a
minimum
.
Best
Practice
4
:
Use
a
variety
of
large
group
,
small
group
,
and
individual
work
experiences
A
community
works
well
when
there
are
a
variety
of
activities
and
experiences
.
Online
courses
can
be
more
enjoyable
and
I
ve
when
students
have
the
opportunity
to
brainstorm
and
work
through
concepts
and
assignments
with
either
one
or
two
or
more
fellow
students
.
At
the
same
time
some
students
work
and
learn
best
on
their
own
.
So
,
building
in
options
and
opportunities
for
students
to
work
together
and
individually
is
highly
recommended
.
Working
in
teams
is
particularly
I
ve
when
working
on
complex
case
studies
or
scenarios
for
the
first
time
.
Best
Practice
5
:
Use
both
synchronous
and
asynchronous
activities
When
online
courses
were
first
introduced
,
they
were
almost
totally
asynchronous
an
updated
version
of
the
distance
learning
courses
by
correspondence
.
Now
we
have
course
management
systems
and
virtual
I
ve
classrooms
and
audio
tools
that
make
it
possible
to
do
almost
everything
we
do
in
campus
classrooms
.
Plus
we
can
often
engage
learners
in
more
I
ve
and
more
I
ve
activities
,
and
what
happens
is
recorded
and
archived
and
there
for
review
and
occasionally
revision
.
Sometimes
there
is
nothing
better
than
a
real
-
time
I
ve
brainstorming
and
sharing
discussion
;
other
times
the
requirement
to
think
,
plan
,
write
and
summarize
is
what
makes
learning
most
I
ve
for
an
individual
.
The
variety
of
activities
that
are
now
possible
online
makes
it
possible
to
create
many
types
of
I
ve
learning
environments
.
For
example
,
in
many
financial
and
statistical
courses
,
real
time
problem
-
solving
and
question
and
answer
review
sessions
can
be
very
I
ve
learning
experiences
.
While
working
professionals
often
choose
to
complete
advanced
degrees
online
so
that
they
can
make
use
of
the
asynchronous
,
anytime
,
anywhere
features
of
a
program
,
these
same
learners
enjoy
getting
together
from
anywhere
at
a
specific
time
to
interact
in
real
time
.

on
what
is
working
well
in
a
course
and
what
might
help
them
have
a
better

experience
.
This
early
feedback
is
done
early
in
the
course
so
corrections
and
modifications
can
be
made
.
It
is
an
easy
opening
for
students
who
might
have

Discussions
in
an

are
the
equivalent
of
class
discussions
in

A
key
difference
,
of
course
,
is
that
these
discussions
are
asynchronous
,
providing
time
for
thought
and
reflection
and
requiring
written
or
audio
responses
that
become

of

Why
do
you
think
that
?
What
is
your
reasoning
?
Is
there
an
I
ve
strategy
?
Ask
clarifying
questions
that
encourage
students
to
think
about
what
they
know
and
do
n't
know
.
Stagger
due
dates
of
the
responses
and
consider
mid
-
point
summary
and
encouraging
comments
Provide
guidelines
and
instruction
on
responding
to
other
students
.
For
example
,
suggest
a
two
-
part
response
:
(
1
)
what
you
liked
or
agreed
with
or
what
resonated
with
you
,
and
(
2
)
a
follow
-
up
question
such
as
what
you
are
wondering
about
or
curious
about
,
etc
.
Provide
choices
and
options
for
students
.
Providing
choices
for
students
in
questioning
follows
the
principle
of
providing
options
for
personalized
and
customized
learning
for
students
and
a
way
of
validating
and
affirming
knowledge
and
skills
.
Working
professionals
are
often
grappling
with
many
issues
providing
choices
and
options
makes
it
possible
to
link
the
learning
more
directly
with
their
work
experiences
and
needs
.
Do
n't
post
questions
soliciting
basic
facts
,
or
questions
for
which
there
is
an
obvious
yes
response
.
The
reason
for
this
is
obvious
.
Once
one
student
responds
,
there
is
not
much
more
to
say
!
Very
specific
fact
-
based
questions
that
you
want
to
be
sure
that
you
students
know
are
best
used
in
practice
quizzes
.

Best
Practice
8
:
Focus
on
content
resources
and
applications
and
links
to
current
events
and
examples
that
are
easily
accessed
from
learner
's
computers
If
content
is
not
digital
,
it
is
as
if
it
does
not
exist
for
students
.
This
means
that
the
content
that
students
will
more
likely
use
is
that
content
and
applications
that
are
available
from
their
computers
.
Students
want
to
be
learning
anywhere
,
anytime
and
often
while
they
are
doing
other
things
,
such
as
driving
,
exercising
,
etc
.
Carrying
around
large
,
heavy
textbooks
and
even
laptops
sometimes
feels
like
an
anachronism
.
Content
that
is
mobile
and
can
be
accessed
via
smartphones
,
ipads
,
ipods
,
and
mp3
players
are
welcome
additions
for
many
students
.
For
many
courses
and
disciplines
,
however
,
textbooks
are
not
yet
available
in
digital
form
,
so
this
best
practice
applies
mostly
to
supplementary
resources
and
to
library
resources
.
A
reference
document
with
detailed
instructions
on
accessing
library
resources
is
included
in
most
courses
.
Additionally
,
a
key
member
of
the
instructional
team
is
the
library
reference
person
assigned
to
supporting
online
learners
.
Students
enjoy
seeing
how
what
they
are
learning
links
to
current
news
events
.
Thus
,
building
into
a
course
discussions
and
links
to
current
events
is
often
motivating
to
learners
.
So
,
this
best
practice
includes
the
following
:
"
encourage
students
to
help
make
the
best
use
of
the
world
of
Internet
resources
.
"
Here
are
some
ideas
.
Enlist
student
assistance
in
identifying
high
quality
content
that
is
available
online
.
This
can
include
tutorials
,
simulations
and
supplementary
stat
material
online
.
Incorporate
into
assignments
and
discussions
how
the
various
statistical
tools
are
used
in
professional
situations
and
in
decision
-
making
.
Include
examples
of
when
and
why
they
helped
and
perhaps
when
they
went
awry
.
This
best
practice
combines
a
number
of
basic
learning
principles
,
explained
in
length
in
other
resources
.
Very
briefly
,
it
means
that
faculty
identify
the
core
concepts
to
be
learned
in
a
course
the
performance
goals
and
then
mentor
learners
through
a
set
of
increasingly
complex
and
even
customized
projects
applying
these
core
concepts
.
Many
online
learners
within
professional
certificate
programs
are
working
professionals
.
Supporting
learners
with
their
professional
goals
that
are
closely
linked
to
the
performance
goals
of
a
course
and
even
beyond
the
course
parameters
is
a
win
-
win
for
the
learners
individually
and
as
a
class
.
How
does
one
do
this
?
Building
in
options
and
choices
in
assignments
and
special
projects
is
a
way
to
do
this
.
Another
key
principle
that
aids
in
concept
learning
comes
from
Vygotsky
(
1962
,
1978
)
.
Vygotsky
notes
that
concepts
are
not
words
,
but
rather
organized
and
intricate
knowledge
clusters
.
This
is
a
simple
,
but
profound
principle
.
This
means
that
while
we
must
teach
in
a
linear
fashion
,
presenting
concepts
individually
and
in
small
clusters
,
we
need
to
apply
concepts
within
case
studies
,
problems
and
analyses
that
combine
concepts
and
principles
within
a
context
.
Effectively
learning
concepts
as
we
know
from
novice
and
expert
studies
requires
a
focus
on
patterns
and
relationships
and
not
individual
facts
or
vocabulary
.
When
faced
with
a
new
field
or
discipline
,
students
often
focus
on
learning
the
vocabulary
of
a
discipline
,
but
this
activity
is
often
done
in
isolation
from
an
understanding
of
the
concepts
that
I
ve
the
words
meaning
.
Without
the
underlying
concepts
,
words
are
akin
to
isolated
"
weeds
"
and
"
seeds
"
likely
to
be
blown
away
by
the
winds
of
time
,
usually
mere
hours
after
an
exam
.
A
popular
new
teaching
and
learning
mantra
advocates
making
students
'
thinking
visible
.
Making
our
thinking
visible
requires
students
to
create
,
talk
,
write
,
explain
,
analyze
,
judge
,
report
and
inquire
.
These
types
of
activities
make
it
clear
to
students
themselves
,
to
the
faculty
,
and
to
fellow
learners
what
students
know
or
do
n't
know
,
what
they
are
puzzled
about
and
about
what
they
might
be
curious
.
Such
activities
stimulate
student
's
growth
from
concept
awareness
to
concept
acquisition
,
building
in
that
"
series
of
intellectual
operations
"
that
Vygotsky
believes
is
required
for
concept
acquisition
.
Discussion
forums
,
blogging
,
journals
and
small
group
work
are
all
excellent
strategies
for
engaging
learners
in
clarifying
and
enlarging
their
mental
models
or
concepts
and
building
links
and
identifying
relationships
.
Best
Practice
10
:
Plan
a
good
closing
and
wrap
activity
for
the
course
As
courses
come
to
a
close
,
it
is
easy
to
forget
the
value
of
a
good
closing
experience
.
In
the
final
weeks
of
a
course
,
students
are
likely
to
be
stressed
and
not
take
the
time
to
do
the
lists
and
the
planning
that
can
help
reduce
stress
and
provide
a
calming
atmosphere
.
A
favorite
image
of
mine
is
from
David
Allen
of
Getting
Things
Done
.
Allen
notes
that
making
a
list
helps
us
to
clear
the
"
psychic
ram
"
of
our
brains
and
we
feel
more
relaxed
and
more
in
control
.
Once
we
have
made
our
list
and
schedule
,
we
do
n't
have
to
continually
remind
ourselves
of
what
needs
to
be
done
and
when
.
Here
are
a
few
hints
for
closing
out
a
course
experience
with
style
and
panache
.
Take
time
to
remind
students
of
what
's
next
and
when
assignments
and
readings
are
due
.
Announcements
of
this
type
provide
a
"
to
Do
"
list
and
schedule
for
the
learners
.
And
by
implication
this
list
provides
a
helpful
"
to
Do
"
list
and
schedule
for
you
.
As
always
,
it
is
good
to
post
reminders
and
make
references
to
the
planning
list
in
your
comments
.
And
update
as
you
go
.
Plan
the
ending
of
the
course
experience
.
A
well
-
designed
ending
of
a
course
provides
opportunities
for
reflection
and
integration
of
useful
knowledge
.
It
is
also
a
time
to
wrap
up
I
ve
social
and
I
ve
experiences
.
End
-
of
-
course
experiences
often
include
student
presentations
,
summaries
and
analyses
.
These
reports
and
presentations
provide
insights
into
just
what
useful
knowledge
students
are
taking
away
from
a
course
and
a
final
opportunity
for
faculty
to
remind
students
of
core
concepts
and
fundamental
principles
.
Concluding
Thought
Traditional
courses
have
long
focused
on
tools
and
techniques
for
the
presentation
of
content
.
Traditional
concerns
from
faculty
focused
on
covering
the
material
,
getting
through
the
book
and
meeting
expectations
so
that
faculty
in
other
courses
will
n't
muse
and
wonder
,
"
did
n't
you
learn
these
concepts
from
faculty
X
?
"
And
"
did
n't
you
study
the
work
and
contributions
of
____
(
fill
in
your
favorite
who
)
"
A
major
drawback
with
designing
for
content
as
a
priority
is
that
it
focuses
attention
on
what
the
faculty
member
is
doing
,
thinking
and
talking
about
and
not
on
the
interaction
and
engagement
of
students
with
the
core
concepts
and
skills
of
a
course
.
The
new
focus
on
learners
encourages
a
focus
on
learners
as
a
priority
.
The
new
focus
on
the
learner
is
to
develop
a
habit
of
asking
,
what
is
going
on
inside
the
learner
's
head
?
How
much
of
the
content
is
being
integrated
into
their
knowledge
base
?
How
much
of
the
content
and
the
tools
can
he
actually
use
?
What
are
students
thinking
and
how
did
they
I
ve
at
their
I
ve
positions
?
Additionally
,
we
are
seeing
a
shift
to
looking
at
the
student
no
only
as
an
individual
,
but
as
an
individual
within
the
learning
community
.
Other
questions
that
we
are
now
considering
include
:
How
is
the
learner
supporting
the
community
of
learners
and
contributing
to
the
overall
growth
of
the
group
?
We
have
much
to
learn
about
teaching
and
learning
and
specifically
about
teaching
online
.
The
good
news
is
that
in
2011
we
now
know
much
more
than
what
we
did
in
1990
or
even
2000
.

teaching

Protection
from
Harassment
Nobody
has
to
suffer
persecution
or
harassment
from
their
neighbours
,
no
matter
what
has
motivated
the
perpetrator
to
do
this
to
you
in
the
first
place
,
and
you
are
protected
by
the
law
in
this
regard
.
Some
instances
of
harassment
arise
as
a
result
of
a
dispute
between
neighbours
which
has
escalated
out
of
control
.
Sometimes
it
's
down
to
anti
-
social
behaviour
by
irresponsible
youths
,
other
times
it
may
be
due
to
a
long
-
running
dispute
with
a
neighbour
.
Your
harassment
may
be
motivated
by
perceived
differences
between
you
and
the
rest
of
your
neighbourhood
by
a
neighbour(s
)
and
these
are
usually
of
a
Discriminatory
Nature
which
is
dealt
with
in
another
article
contained
on
this
website
.
What
Constitutes
Harassment
?
Harassment
can
occur
in
many
forms
.
It
can
include
,
but
is
not
limited
to
,
the
following
types
of
behaviour
:
Threats
of
violence
against
you
or
an
actual
act
of
violence
committed
upon
you
I
ve
and
insulting
behaviour
or
words
Threats
of
damage
to
your
property
and
possessions
or
actual
damage
to
them
Any
written
form
of
abuse
or
threat
made
to
you
,
including
letters
,
graffiti
or
any
other
kind
of
written
material
such
as
posters
being
put
up
that
are
derogatory
towards
you
Basically
,
harassment
can
be
any
type
of
behaviour
or
action
taken
towards
you
which
threatens
your
own
sense
of
security
and
peace
or
which
causes
you
unnecessary
inconvenience
.
What
You
Can
Do
if
You
Become
a
I
m
of
Harassment
If
you
feel
that
you
are
being
harassed
,
you
should
immediately
notify
the
police
.
It
's
also
useful
if
you
have
Kept
Written
Records
of
all
the
occasions
when
any
harassment
has
took
place
,
including
what
form
the
harassment
you
suffered
,
the
date
and
time
it
took
place
,
and
a
name
or
description
of
the
perpetrator(s
)
.
Even
if
you
have
n't
gathered
all
of
this
information
or
you
do
n't
know
who
might
be
responsible
,
just
I
ve
the
police
as
much
information
as
you
can
.
The
more
you
can
tell
them
,
the
quicker
and
easier
it
will
be
to
get
the
harassment
to
stop
and
to
instigate
any
legal
proceedings
that
might
be
necessary
.
Once
you
have
been
interviewed
by
the
police
,
they
will
be
on
hand
to
offer
you
any
advice
while
they
conduct
their
investigations
.
What
Happens
Next
?
The
police
take
harassment
issues
very
seriously
.
They
will
be
there
to
support
you
although
the
level
will
vary
depending
upon
the
severity
of
the
harassment
which
has
taken
place
.
They
will
also
offer
you
all
the
required
information
and
guidance
you
might
need
if
the
matter
goes
to
court
.
Depending
on
the
nature
of
the
harassment
,
they
'll
also
put
you
in
touch
with
relevant
external
organisations
or
agencies
that
will
be
able
to
I
ve
you
specialised
support
and
further
counselling
assistance
,
if
needed
.
If
You
I
ve
in
Rented
Accommodation
If
you
I
ve
in
rented
accommodation
,
you
should
also
inform
your
landlord
,
local
authority
or
housing
association
.
They
can
offer
additional
support
which
might
include
fitting
locks
,
vandal
-
proof
letterboxes
,
fences
and
lighting
,
and
installing
alarms
which
might
even
be
linked
to
your
local
police
station
.
If
your
perpetrator
lives
in
the
same
building
as
you
,
they
can
also
confront
them
and
warn
them
about
possible
tenancy
agreement
breaches
,
and
the
possibility
of
eviction
.
In
the
case
of
local
authorities
and
housing
associations
,
they
might
also
be
able
to
assist
in
re
-
housing
you
elsewhere
if
that
's
the
decision
you
feel
would
be
best
for
you
.
However
,
if
you
like
living
in
your
present
home
,
you
should
feel
under
no
compulsion
to
move
,
and
your
local
authority
will
take
all
the
necessary
steps
and
offer
you
the
support
to
enable
you
to
remain
put
.
Nobody
should
ever
feel
compelled
to
be
driven
out
of
their
home
and
neighbourhood
against
their
he
s
because
of
a
harassment
issue
.
Harassment
is
a
serious
offence
,
can
cause
unbearable
stress
and
will
be
dealt
with
harshly
by
the
police
and
the
legal
system
.
We

I
I
ve
above
someone
who
has
been
harrasing
me
and
my
7
year
old
daughter
for
over
a
year
now
.
He
has
mental
behaviour
issues
and
is
considered
by
my
landlord
(
housing
association
)
to
be
extremely
vulnerable
,
not
us
!
The
torment
he
has
given
to
myself
and
my
7
year
old
daughter
does
nt
matter
neither
does
the
fact
he
is
a
registered
sex
offender
threatening
to
take
my
daughter
away
.
Police
not
helpful
because
of
his
frame
of
mind
and
lanlord
will
nt
move
us
as
they
have
zero
tolerance
of
anti
social
behaviour
and
will
not
move
tenants
to
resolve
it
.
On
top
of
the
harassment
I
have
to
tolerate
I
m
digging
and
tunneling
through
the
cavity
in
the
walls
and
crawling
in
my
ceiling
cavity
.
At
my
wits
end
,
let
down
by
every
single
local
government
organisation
and
living
in
fear
incase
he
crosses
the
bounderies
again
into
our
home
while
we
are
sleeping
,
this
next
time
it
may
be
worse
.

I
had
the

being
hauled
into
court
due
to
a
I

neighbour
who
saw
fit
to
make
up
all

of
nonesensical
allegations
against

which
were
so

She
conned

I
was
wholly
innocent

It
upsets
me
to

worst
of

I

I
moved
into
a
gorgeous
home
last
week
of
July
this
year
(
2012
)
I
knew
I
was
going
to
have
an
issue
with
the
occupiers
of
the
propeerty
immediately
to
the
right
of
my
home
.
She
is
a
teacher
and
he
works
away
for
long
periods
as
an
engineer
in
the
mercahnt
navy
.
The
very
first
day
I
moved
in
they
delibverately
parked
their
car
behind
the
removals
van
to
stop
them
being
able
to
open
the
van
door
.
From
then
they
constantly
slam
doors
very
early
inb
the
morning
and
very
late
at
night
.
They
stare
through
my
wndows
constantly
and
have
now
dumped
their
refuse
bins
immediately
in
front
of
my
kitchen
window
.
Now
they
stare
through
into
my
home
whenever
dumping
rubbish
into
the
bins
.
They
even
tried
to
intimadte
my
young
son
.
Lately
I
have
found
screws
in
my
tyres
of
my
car
and
damage
appearing
constantly
.
I
ve
just
found
out
they
have
keys
to
my
home
and
I
ve
found
items
missing
,
such
as
my
driving
licence&gt
;
to
make
matters
worse
they
are
now
making
false
claims
to
the
police
saying
I
am
harrassing
them
.
I
ve
treied
everything
to
avoid
them
and
even
keep
my
curtains
closed
on
their
sode
but
nothing
works
.
She
is
also
racialist
and
makes
tracist
remarks
about
the
puils
she
teaches
.

have
the
upstairs
neighbour
from
hell.she
is
nocturnal
and
spends
all
night
storming
around
her
bedroom
directly
above
mine
and
thinks
nothing
of
shifting
a
bit
of
furniture
around
at
3am.she
also
likes
to
phone
for
an
Ambulance
running
around
shouting
"
help"all
this
is
made
possible
by
the
benefits
paid
to
her
allowing
her
to
sleep
all
day
whilst
I
am
at
work.i
am
a
council
tenant
and
have
been
told
by
the
Anti
Social
behaviour
team
that
I
have
to
put
up
with
this
as
it
is
"
part
of
her
illness
"
,
however
I
am
at
my
wits
end
after
4
years
on
2hours
sleep
per
night
if
I
am
lucky.i
think
she
should
be
in
sheltered
accomodation.any

Pm
I
moved
into
a
beautiful
ground
floor
victorian
conversion
6
weeks
ago
.
The
morning
I
arrived
I
was
waiting
outside
for
the
removal
van
to
I
ve
when
a
very
drunk
man
on
the
1st
floor
opened
his
window
&
started
shouting
&
swearing
at
us
for
slamming
the
door
all
day
.
We
had
been
there
2
minutes
.
Later
that
day
after
moving
all
our
stuff
in
we
noticed
a
man
with
his
face
he
d
up
against
the
window
looking
in
.
He
saw
us
but
that
did
not
deter
I
m
from
scanning
the
room
&
my
stuff
.
I
went
out
to
ask
the
man
what
he
wanted
&
he
just
he
d
pass
me
&
went
up
to
the
1st
floor
flat
.
About
30
minutes
later
he
came
down
&
I
asked
I
m
why
he
was
looking
in
my
window
.
He
went
off
like
a
firework
,
shouting
&
swearing
at
me
&
trying
to
attack
me
.
If
my
friend
had
n't
of
been
there
he
would
have
.
Since
then
I
have
endured
a
string
of
abuse
&
intimidation
from
these
two
men
,
who
are
brothers
.
I
go
&
stay
with
relatives
a
lot
just
to
get
away
from
it
.
The
police
have
served
them
both
with
harassment
warnings
&
they
have
been
arrested
several
times
.
The
lady
who
lived
on
the
top
floor
for
28
years
moved
out
last
week
because
she
could
n't
take
anymore
.
She
has
been
enduring
it
for
4
years
since
he
moved
in
.
The
housing
association
do
n't
seem
to
care
.
They
say
they
are
dealing
with
it
but
you
ring
up
for
an
update
&
nothing
has
been
done
.
It
seems
being
a
decent
civilised
tenant
does
n't
count
for
much
.
The
man
upstairs
does
not
work
because
he
says
he
has
a
disability
.
His
disability
does
not
stop
I
m
walking
to
the
of
licence
everyday
to
buy
10
cans
of
special
brew
!
I
did
n't
think
things
could
get
any
worse
but
the
new
tenant
that
has
moved
into
the
top
flat
is
a
nightmare
.
She
is
very
young
,
has
2
pit
bulls
,
blasts
music
all
the
time
&
has
a
constant
stream
of
people
coming
&
going
,
slamming
doors
,
thundering
up
&
down
the
stairs
&
being
incredibly
noisy
until
the
early
hours
.
She
has
no
garden
so
why
the
Ha
would
allow
her
to
keep
2
dogs
astounds
me
.
I
have
since
learnt
that
the
man
upstairs
has
been
in
prison
for
stabbing
someone
&
has
a
long
criminal
record
for
violence
.
I
am
incredibly
angry
with
the
Ha
.
They
should
have
told
me
about
the
man
upstairs
.
Why
would
you
put
a
man
like
that
in
a
building
with
2
single
women
?
I
wish
I
had
never
moved
here
!
Is
it
possible
to
sue
your
Ha
?

The
police
and
the
council
can
apparently
do
nothing
to
stop
someone
harassing
you
if
they
have
issues
.
They
deemed
our
neighbour
mentally
incapable
of
understanding
a
restraining
order
or
asbo
so
she
is
allowed
to
continue
torturing
us
.
Her
boyfriend
is
now
joining
on
but
because
he
never
he
s
his
threats
by
specifying
what
he
is
going
to
do
to
is
they
can
n't
do
anything
about
I
m
either
.
I
feel
as
though
either
our
property
or
person
needs
to
be
attacked
before
they
will
do
anything
,
should
n't
we
be
protected
before
not
after????

I
moved
into
my
flat
in
June
2011
the
instance
I
moved
in
my
neighbor
greeted
me
by
telling
me
not
to
walk
on
her
grass
as
it
was
in
her
tenancy
and
if
I
did
so
again
she
would
report
me
to
the
housing
association
,
I
am
a
single
mum
of
my
three
year
old
little
boy
Thomas
,
my
neighbors
reported
me
because
there
was
a
maggot
infestation
in
my
bin
which
I
sorted
as
soon
as
they
made
me
aware
,
they
report
me
if
my
little
boy
runs
about
,
they
report
me
if
my
visitors
close
my
door
loudly.
.
.
it
's
been
nothing
but
constant
reports
from
my
neighbors
they
've
threatened
me
,
shouted
abuse
at
me
,
the
housing
manager
is
n't
interested
in
what
I
have
to
say
in
my
defense
and
does
nothing
to
help
assist
me
,
I
feel
like
a
prisoner
in
my
own
home.

my
child
has
Adhd
and
I
do
what
I
can
to
stop
I
m
from
making
noise

I
've
been
made
to

mediation
where
I
was
interigated
further
and
the
mediator
would
not
take
my
complaints
about
my

harassment
on

either
I
am

take
anti
