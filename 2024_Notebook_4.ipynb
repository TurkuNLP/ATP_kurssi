            "OP AV\t0348059\tTalk To Your Parents Sometimes, people just don't feel well. But if you don't feel well more than sometimes, it may be helpful to talk to someone about it. Why might it be helpful to talk to a family member? A lot of people just don't want to talk about difficult experiences. Everyone has their own reason to keep quiet. Some people may have a lot of inside fears: they don't want to admit that there is something wrong, they blame themselves, they don't think anyone else will understand. Other people may have a lot of outside fears: they don't want other people to find out, they don't want to lose friends, they don't want to disappoint anyone, they don't want other people to take care of them. The problem is that it can be really tough to deal with difficult feeling on your own. But it's also hard to find support if you don't ask for support. Often, the quickest and most direct way to find support is to ask for it. Part of being strong and in control is knowing when to ask for help. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can really help people feel better. There is another reason for talking with a family member. If you're dealing with the health care system, like going to doctor's appointments, you may need an adult's help. What do we mean by \"family member?\" A family member is anyone in your support circle that you feel you can rely on. It could be a parent or step-parent, an aunt or an uncle, an older sister or brother, or a grandparent. It could also be someone from your community, like a teacher or other school staff member, a friend's parents, or a family friend. Talking to a family member Talking to a family member is a huge step. No matter what happens, you should feel proud that you brought your concerns into the open. It takes a lot of courage! One way to tackle the first conversation is to prepare ahead of time. If you know what you want and know how you want to say it, it can be easier to bring up with other people. Below, you'll see different points to think about. Sometime, family members don't react to these tough conversations in helpful ways. Remember, you are not responsible for their reaction. Their reaction reflects them, not you. You can't control how other people react, but you can control how you react. Before the conversation Think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Sometime people even write notes to help organize their thoughts. Think about what you want to come out of the conversation. Do you need a family member to help you see a doctor or other health professional? Do you want to try new strategies at home? Do you just want to talk? Think about the best time and place to bring up the conversation. If you try to talk to a family member when they're busy, tired or stressed out, they may not be able to listen as well as they'd like. You can even ask when they're available to talk about something important and ask them to set aside the time for you. During the conversation Don't be afraid to take control. It's hard to talk about difficult feelings or experiences. Some people find that it's easier to say what they feel if they can just get it out without interruptions. Try, \"It's hard for me to talk about this. It would really help if you just listen until I'm finished. Then we can talk about it together.\" Try to be honest and direct. A family member needs to understand what the problem is and what you want them to do about it. Try to be clear about why you're having the conversation and what you want to happen next. Try to stay on topic. This isn't the time to bring up old fights or disagreements. If a family member  isn't staying on topic, you can always remind them why you're talking. Try, \"I know you're upset about (something that's happened), but right now I need to talk to you about the way I've been feeling.\" Try to keep your cool. Yelling, getting angry or getting defensive can really derail a conversation. If you feel very angry or upset, it may be more helpful to take a break. Prepare back-up. Some people don't have all the information about mental health. If they don't get the problem, they may not know what to do. Suggest resources that they can check out, like the organizations [in the resource section]. You can always continue the conversation after they've checked out information for themselves. End an unhelpful conversation. Sometimes, a family member won't know what to do or say. They might react poorly or just not say anything that all. This can be frustrating, especially when you're trying to reach out for help! If you're having a hard time making the conversation work, it may be helpful to end it for a while. This will give everyone a chance to think about the issues. Try, \"I don't think this is working right now and I'm feeling really frustrated. Can we take a break and pick up the conversation in two days?\" After the conversation Awesome -- you've made it through the really tough part! If you conversation went well, you can start planning your next steps. If you don't think your conversation ended well, try not to feel discouraged. These conversations are tough for everyone. Some people don't react well when they have to hear something difficult or emotional. If you think that your family member just need some time and information, think of how you might work together to learn more and work together. For example, you could suggest resources you like and schedule another conversation later in the week. If you just don't think this is going work, it may be time to ask for outside help. Think about the options below and decide what feel most comfortable. What if I just can't talk to my parents? Sometimes, you just can't talk to people in your family. This can be really hard to handle, but it's important to keep trying until you find someone that can help. Here are a few suggestions: Your school counsellor A teacher you trust Another family member, like an older brother or sister or an aunt or uncle \n",
            "NA OP SR OB\t3086555\tThe Top TEN 'Whiniest Sets of Fans' in English Football The art of moaning is almost intrinsically built within us as football fans. As much as we love a 30-yard-screamer or a derby day thumping, we also love to indulge in a spot of match-day whining. As good as a match-day is, it just wouldn't be the same without finding something to kick-off about. No matter how well your team have performed, be it the extortionate Yorkie bar that has forced you to break into a fiver, to your teams' right-back's insistence on wearing gloves in August, we simply love to whine. But for some fans, a bit of harmless complaining resembles so much more than a simple bit of fun- it is a way of life. Indeed, for this bunch, the whining is incessant, the fickleness is in abundance and their unworldly levels of expectation simply will never be satisfied. In no particular order, here is an over the top, over exaggerative, completely unbalanced yet painfully true take on ten of the whiniest fans in English football. \n",
            "NA NE\t0355982\tFerry consultation needs deeper questions, says advocate A transportation advocacy group is circulating a list of 100 questions aimed at broadening the British Columbia government's consultation on coastal ferry services. \"Every aspect of the ferry system has to be looked at and the data has to be complete,\" said Gregg Dow, the president of the BC Coastal Transportation Society. \"We just demonstrated how complicated it is. It's a disservice of the provincial government not to bring that into the decision making process.\" The provincial government is at the start of a $700,000 consultation process Transportation Minister Mary Polak launched in late October aimed at cutting $26 million from BC Ferries' budget. Through a request for proposals process to run the consultation, the transportation ministry hired Kirk & Co. Consulting Ltd. in August. Elections BC records show Kirk & Co. has been a regular donor to the BC Liberal Party. The company has given nearly $12,000 to the governing party since 2005, and principal Judy Kirk has also made personal donations to the Liberals. Materials circulated as part of the consultation process look at the cost of each route, its capacity and how much it is used. There are many other factors that come into play, including regulations around things like crewing levels, transportation of dangerous goods and weight allowances, said Dow. \"What impacts will it have on the economies of these communities? Has the governemnt even looked at that?\" Many of the questions focus on how BC Ferries and the government calculated the capacity that they say is under used. The full list is available on the BCCTS website . Here are 12 of them: Has the Government/BC Ferries undertaken an evaluation of what constitutes 'Core Ferry Service'? It appears the Government is prepared to adjust Core Ferry Services downward in response to BC Ferries' escalating cost overruns. At what point does the Government determine Core Ferry Services will have bottomed out? Is the Government aware if any of the costs of the new BC Ferries Head Office has been allocated out to the fleet? Is the Government aware if any of the costs of the BC Ferries Vacation Centre have allocated out to the fleet? How have the two boards of directors expenses been allocated to the fleet, since 2003? When BC Ferries replaces vessels on Route 1, exchanging a Spirit Class Vessel with a Super C, they've reduced the capacity for those sailings. Did the Province review and account for the differences in capacity between vessels? Do BC Ferries' policies around on time performance -- specifically in how it determines how the vessels are to be loaded, cut-off times, and the handling of traffic in the terminals -- ultimately defeat its ability to meet maximum capacity utilization targets? Has the Government considered reductions to Management Bonus Plans to reduce drain on the fare and subsidy revenue at BCFS and thus protect farepayers and taxpayers interests? How does BC Ferries' Reservations policy affect capacity? Has the Government/BC Ferries determined if it is a deterrent to travel for some potential passengers? Has the Government evaluated what impact the loss of Tourism BC for three years had on ridership at BC Ferries? A large percentage of the loss posted to each route comprises the cost of central management, the cost of ship refits and terminal upgrades, and the cost of financing and amortization of BCF's $1.4 billion dollar debt. In what way will deep cuts to service reduce these expenses? In 2002, the Government promised improved service and predictable fares. The current consultation process the Government is undertaking demonstrates the business model isn't working. At what point does the government go back to the legislation and fix it? Andrew MacLeod is The Tyee's Legislative Bureau Chief in Victoria. Find him on Twitter or reach him here . Illahie If ferries is actually a private corporation If ferries is actually a private corporation, who gives a hoot whether they made a bad deal with government, and lose money as a result? If Exon or some other public company were to lose money would our provincial government try to help out. If ferries is actually government, then the operation should be treated like government. If the costs of maintaining our highways were to go up, the government would fund the increased costs of maintaining our roads. If the provincial government wants to get ferries back in the black, all they have to do is take back the 1.3 billion or so in debt that was wracked up David Hahn during his tenure. The interest payments on the Hahn debt is causing ferries to lose money. Dave50 Gulf island ferries BC Ferries does not want to touch the huge hog trough pay raises and bonuses to their executives.Total cost of 'management' should be 10% of operations ... I'll bet its nearly half the cost of personnel and not needed. When the liberal government hands you money and you have a monopoly you should balance the books every time.The BC liberal government is directly 100% responsible for the bad shape of BC ferries.The BC liberals paid ex BC ferries CEO David Hahn more than the prime minster and all, the admiral in the navy combined.Why would someone choose to move to the gulf island , then whine and cry about the ferry service.If you choose to live on the gulf island then get out your wallet, or buy a boat and commute back and forth.Half the trips are running a less than 1/4 capacity.Some living in a million dollar gulf island waterfront house trying to commute daily back and forth should not be totally subsidized by the taxpayer.Blame the BC liberal,Bc ferries paid David Hahn more than a 5 star adimral in the USA navy for running a 36 ship fleet which could be run out of a one room office.David hahn 48,000 a month pension benifit is what the Bc fiberl pay 70 people at 700.00 a month. But the actual blame for this must be laid squarely at the feet of those in Victoriathe BC Fiberals whom we elected to be the guardians of the public trust. If our politicians are willing to pay Hahn more than the Prime Minister and the Premier of BC combined, they're the ones who are to blame for this absolute travesty Ex Bc ferries liberal appointee David Hahn make more in a month pension benefits, than a full time employee working 40 ours or more a week makes in a year, and the every single honest taxpayer in BC has to pay . virimpig BCFerries The total ineptitude of the BCFerries management is a joke! And all this kerfluffle about cutting costs is a prelude to unloading the albatross back to the Dept. of Highways or Transportartion (or whatever Christy's women's auxiliary running this province until next spring calls it) so that it can be handled efficiently without the atronomical levels of management and salaries at FleetHouse!

            "ID DF\t0437920\tI'v been recording and mixing music for about 4 years now. In this time I'v probably done around 100 tracks. My clients are always happy and they do come back but I am not even close to being happy. I really feel like I should be better than I am and feel like I'm just stuck with fairly amateur sounding records. I'm almost at the point where its making me feel depressed and this stress and worry just makes things even harder. I know it sounds a bit extreme but you know when you want something so bad that you just cant have it... thats the feeling! I'v been mixing an EP by a band for about 3 months now and its getting to the point where they're getting a bit peaved off at me. Its a really great record which seems to be heightening the pressure (i dont wanna fluff it up!). The problem is whatever I do I cant settle on anything and i just keep going round in circles trying different stuff, starting again etc etc. I just wonder... will I ever finish it? This is the first time I'v ever felt incapable of mixing something. So I'm just looking for a bit of advice really. I'm sure many people have hit this brick wall. What do you do when you just cant seem to mix something? Hi, You have mixed it...you just didn't know when to stop and move on! Are the band peaved because it sounds bad or at you because you are taking so long? I suggest finishing it...even though you will not be satisfied. Time to let go and learn methinks! Dave More peaved that Im taking so long to finish it.. theyre nice guys so they havent officially said theyre annoyed, but I can sooooo tell! 2 of the tracks I thought were finished, I sent them over and they were not over the moon about them, said they could be improved. Im struggling to improve them! 1. spend 1 day (6 to 10 hours) per mix. Then ask the band for changes. Dont fu.ck about. You're done 2. What band do they sound like? Mix it like that. 3. mix time is NOT creative time ( no matter what the many jocks who do it all tell you; I mix for a living, a proper living - sure there is a bit of creativity but you're not trying to make the song be something else - if you're trying to get John Bonham drums but the drummer plays like a punk then you're wasting your time. Secondly - if you want John Bonhma drums you have to record John Bonham drums. If you have recorded tight sounding drums then that is what you go for ). You RECORD a record - mixing is about fulfilling what you promised at recording.... in other words mix what's there. And when you get feedback from the band that it 'isn't right', don't settle for that and keep going round in circles. Get them to commit and say WHY they don't think it is right, and WHAT they think is wrong. They need to give you a clear idea of where to focus, it's their record after all. This has happened to me when I don't have a clear idea from the outset how the finished product is supposed to sound. Either the band gives you that, or you bring that vision to them. If neither of you has it then any technically competent mix is pretty much as good as any other. So you might as well just stop and hand it back to the band. Presumably they are not paying you for all this soul searching? I have learned to close down projects like this fairly quickly. Who are you trying to please here? If the band are happy with your last mix, that's the mix. If they have specific requirements that you are struggling to fulfill then what are the barriers, and are we really talking about performance and arrangement issues? You can't own the whole problem, the band has responsibilities too While I like to have some time on my own when I'm starting a mix so that I can do all the tidying up and getting basic sounds without someone breathing down my neck, when it gets towards the end of the process I find it helpful to have someone from the band there with me. Maybe not the whole band as things can get very confusing with too many opinions but it helps to have ideas from someone else. I'd also agree that if a mix is taking more than a few hours there's probably something more fundamental wrong with it. Hey Chewy, I have been in similar positions to yourself, but maybe because i am a bit of a t@&% , I have no problem explaining to bands/artists, A) my limitations, given the equipment/environment I have and the price I charge and B) their expectations given their skills and the price they are paying. The bottom line is, you have done your best, if they want it better, either they should pay you more or you give them the files so that someone else can mix ....OR they pay more at the outset for a higher end studio....DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP TOO MUCH!.....only a little! Dave In other words, four years isn't a long time to be learning your chops. You learn on every mix for decades. Or you should. But three months to mix a few tracks (assuming you're working solid) is a very long time. You need to be clear about when you're solving problems/refining a mix, and when you're learning stuff anew. Fine to take a bit of time to do the former. The latter are lessons to be applied to future projects. If you are too insistent on perfection that's by its nature out of reach, you'll never get to the stage where you can mix *anything* to your satisfaction. Wise words above about finishing a mix relatively quickly and then getting specific comments from the band. I'd add to that to talk about expectations, stylistic and sonic influences before the recording session. Get hold of some reference tracks you can use while mixing - not just tunes they like, but how this bit builds to the chorus; how that vocal space/treatment is amazing; how the drums work etc. You have a rough target then and will know what's realistic or be able to suggest alternative directions. The only caveat I'd add is that Narco's advice doesn't relate to all styles of music, nor all interpretations of the title 'mix engineer'. For instance, the line between mixing, programming and remixing is a very blurry one. Whatever it is you're doing, though, and however you interpret the term, be clear about what the band expects of you and what you expect to be doing; and bill/take credit accordingly. Mismatch of those expectations is a huge disappointment for everyone concerned. If you've really hit a block on this particular one, and need to get through it, here's what I recommend... (1) Get a bit of distance from it. Leave it a few days at least. Clear your head - go do something other than mixing. (2) Come back and just listen through once or twice with fresh ears. Don't do anything to it. (3) Next day, listen through with a pen and paper and make a snag list of things to fix/change. Don't get too hung up on technical problems, though do note them. Think about the macro side of things as well as the tiny details -- can you hear the lyrics; is the bass even and sufficiently tight; are the transitions working; does the track build and strip down in the right way. Etc. (4) Then wait another day and come back to work through the list. Half the notes you'll read and thing \"nah, doesn't need it, what was I thinking\"; others will help you focus and move on. (5) When you've made it through that, review it one more time in a similar way on a compressed timescale. And call that a day. (6) Learn from the experience and move on to your next project -- which will be a bit better; as will the next one after that. Etc. They won't be if you go down this road with every mix! I think my advice would be to remember that fundamentally, mixing a band is about balancing the relative levels of the tracks, not about processing them or adding effects. Try stripping back all your plug-ins and getting a mix together using the faders alone, at least as a first step. The only caveat I'd add is that Narco's advice doesn't relate to all styles of music, nor all interpretations of the title 'mix engineer'. For instance, the line between mixing, programming and remixing is a very blurry one. It's not a blurry one when you're hired as a mixer. The blurring comes from having to do several roles - in which cases the blurring is in the role of the person and not in what the person is doing! If you are \"programming\" during a mix then you are not mixing. You are programming, re-arranging, producing etc. Of course, when you are doing several roles it most certainly is easy to get bogged down in transitioning. The trick is to understand exactly where you are in the process - I have the luxury of never mixing my own production work and only mixing work from other recordists/producers!! The only caveat I'd add is that Narco's advice doesn't relate to all styles of music, nor all interpretations of the title 'mix engineer'. For instance, the line between mixing, programming and remixing is a very blurry one. It's not a blurry one when you're hired as a mixer. The blurring comes from having to do several roles - in which cases the blurring is in the role of the person and not in what the person is doing!! If you are \"programming\" during a mix then you are not mixing. You are programming, re-arranging, producing. Once that is DONE then you are mixing!! Hmmm... so its just summing then is it? No effects, no delay lines? No mutes? No tonal changes to anything? I think that it *is* a blurry line when there is no official job description and half the world has a different interpretation of what a mix engineer should do, or be allowed to do to their material. Point being, whatever your role, and whatever you perceive as your role, and whatever you call yourself... it's a good plan to make sure that you and the client have a common understanding of what your role is. ie make sure the client and the contractor have an agreed scope of project and standard of work. Same as in any other walk of life. If a band holds a false assumption/expectation, it's your job to set them straight before you start working. Quote Sam Inglis: mix together using the faders alone, at least as a first step. Good idea. Kinda depends where you are on this mix at the moment, though. And in light of what Narco has said about definition of roles, do make sure that the arrangement, editing etc has been done to your satisfaction before trying to mix. Maybe that's your job too, maybe it isn't. But it will make the basic side of the mix job much easier. Hmmm... so its just summing then is it? No effects, no delay lines? No mutes? No tonal changes to anything? No - that's clearly daft!!! Of course it involves those changes. Quote Matt Houghton: I think that it *is* a blurry line when there is no official job description and half the world has a different interpretation of what a mix engineer should do, or be allowed to do to their material. It's not up for interpretation despite being inter petted!! hahah. A mixers role is to mix the music as per the producers wishes. The problem comes if you are recordist, producer and mixer. Thats when people start to blur roles and that is when issue happen. If you can keep the roles distinct, even if doing them all yourself, then it helps a lot. Quote Matt Houghton: Point being, whatever your role, and whatever you perceive as your role, and whatever you call yourself... it's a good plan to make sure that you and the client have a common understanding of what your role is. ie make sure the client and the contractor have an agreed scope of project and standard of work. Same as in any other walk of life. If a band holds a false assumption/expectation, it's your job to set them straight before you start working. Absolutely right!! But if a band thinks a mixers role is to sort out arrangements then they are in for a surprise! One does do that when requested and of course, sometimes you get into discussions about things not working. Those are production works and they are dealt with on a project by project basis. When you're mixing - you're mixing. The blurring of roles is in people doing multiple jobs.... My advice is separate the roles. DON'T blur the roles, it makes your output far more complicated and you end up chasing your tale. Quote jaminem: I'd spend 400 upgrading my mains cables if I were you. Its the only way to get a decent sounding record. sorry, wrong thread. Wrong thread indeed... Seriously, chew_rocket have you tried to mix something in a studio different than your own? Maybe your problem lies with the acoustics of your control room. Bad acoustics can make mixing very frustrating. It would help if you were more specific about the things that frustrate you: lack of clarity? harshness? lack of loudness? Forget room acoustics for a minute... Can the band play? I mean really play? There's a difference between what some would consider good and what is actually good in a studio recording scenario. Your drummer has to be getting the sounds from his kit to begin with, is he? Is he hitting consistently? You could be running round in circles trying to get the best snare sound from a close mic in one section of a song only to find another section or other hits are completely different, how do you deal with that? Samples? Is he hitting consistently enough to trigger reliable samples? And that's just the drummer! I'm forever putting out mixes I'm not 100% happy with and 99% if the ine the fact is, it's the player's fault and their playng has restricted what I can do. Sad but true. Not everyone can be that good. Some great advice here. Like I said, its never happened before and I think I'm just feeling the pressure to better recordings they have done in the past (they asked if i could better them before they came, I said and thought I could!). Although I'v spent hours and hours on these mixes. Im thinking I'll just start again. Forgot what I'v done and give it another shot! Good luck, but unless you know specifically what it is that you want to be different, and in what way, is it not possible that you will end up in the same place in a few days time? Or if you do know that and just can't get it out of the recordings you are working with you might have to start looking at other options (which I know you must be considering), like - recording some parts again - bringing in someone else for a second opinion/a bit of collaboration - taking the mix to a different environment to mix in - sometimes gives a different perspective I am not an industry professional. But when I read this thread, I thought, customer expectation and requirements -- have they truly been defined and understood. Suggest going through the song section by section with band individuals or in groups and making notes on what they want. Effectively, writing down their requirements. Also worth touching on Roles and Responsibilities; i.e. production, mixing etc..... and what they actually mean and what your scope is. Then agree on any conflicts they have for each section. Summarise this and send to them -- get it signed off if needs be. You then have an agreed brief to work with. Sounds a bit formal, but will help you to get to end of job and close this one off against an agreed spec. i, been reading the thread and thought i'd offer my experience with this situation. i've been polishing a turd for a friend recently (read this months sounding off? - exactly that situation). and have left the tracks for about 3 or 4 weeks, come back to them and it all become clear what needed to be done, mostly removing plug ins that wernt needed and automation issues, and it just fell into place. i'd recommend what people have said above and take a break from it and then listen again and make some notes. Good luck with it though it can be tough with pressure from the band.. anyway back to the day job for me this is something i can relate to....i am my own worst critic.....ive been doing this for about 12 years now and still i get things that im not happy with....after about 5 years of recording bands for a living i noticed something....some people cant really play but talk like they can..it started with a drummer that came in one weekend ....he had the best drum kit i have ever seen..all the best extra bits ...spoke at length about all the recording sessions he had done..so i thought \"this is gonna be a easy day\"..that was until he sat behind the kit...it sounded awful...and i got really frustrated because here was a guy with good set of drums ,witha lot of experiance and i was making him sound like crap...so i spent ages helping him tune the drums but everytime i went into the control room to see if i was making any head-way, it still sounded like crap ...at this point the rest of the band turned up .so i said \"how about you go get a coffee or something i will spend a wee bit of time tuning this kit up\"......so i hit record and off i went to tune the kit...now im not saying im a good drummer but when i sat behind this kit i thought it sounded ace so off i went to the control room to see...to my amazment the kit sounded fine..so when he came back i asked him to play some grooves ...to my amazment he was hitting the drums at the edges and was barely touching the kick pedal and hitting the cymbals so hard they didnt make any noise.truth was he was a rich kid that never set foot in a studio or even played a gig. still got a recording done .. was i happy with the mixes ??? nope.....the band thought the mixes and the session was ace 3 months.....wow thats a long time......to be honest if icant get a mix right in a hour i feel something else is wrong the lesson i learned from that weekend..\"not every band is led zepplin\" its about learning how i can change gear to accomadate the client Happy to report that I had a VERY productive session today. Stopped getting so hung up on little things and just ploughed through a tune. Ended up with FAR less processing than prior mixes and am very happy with it. I actually had a friend who is a musician (but in no way a producer/engineer) come over as a second pair of ears. It really helped me and I think I'm all set to blitz through the rest now. \n",
            "NA SR\t0389025\tThe 25-year-old did have chances at Anfield. But he lacked the composure of his team-mates and already some are starting to question whether the 9.6million signing from Montpellier can have the impact Wenger demands. The Gunners chief believes it is far too early to make negative judgements. And Wenger claimed his battle with Martin Skrtel will prove to be a valuable part of an important learning process. \"I am confident about him,\" said Wenger. \"Giroud is in an adaptation period. He has shown he is ready for a fight and I am sure he will adapt to the intensity of an English striker. \"Against Skrtel he discovered what the Premier League is all about.\" Here's a reminder of what Giroud can achieve in front of goal... Wenger is on much safer ground considering the merits of Abou Diaby. The 26-year-old's qualities have never been questioned. Far more of an issue are the numerous injury problems he has encountered. Diaby was restricted to just four Premier League appearances last term, all as a substitute. However, in the wake of Alex Song's departure, Diaby is more important than ever to the Arsenal cause. Alou Diaby: the new Vieira? Andrew Powell His superb performance at Liverpool was reminiscent of Patrick Vieira in his pomp. Now Wenger just needs the France midfielder to stay healthy. \"If he is fit and healthy, Diaby has the talent,\" said Wenger. \"You can see he is massive for us because he has everything you would want in a midfielder. \"I stood behind him because I know he is not only a fantastic player but a fantastic guy as well. \"He hasn't played for a year but now he looks in good shape. \"There is more to come but let's touch wood and hope it goes well in the next two or three weeks because he is going away with the national team. \n",
            "NA IN HA\t0008510\tElizabethan Science and Technology Elizabethan Period and Elizabethan Science and Technology THE SCIENTIFIC RENAISSANCE The Middle Ages were not by any means ignorant of science, but its study naturally received a great impetus when the Renaissance brought before educated men all that the Greeks and Romans had done in mathematics, physics, astronomy, medicine, and other subjects. The invention of printing also fostered the scientific revival by making it easy to spread knowledge abroad in every land. The pioneers of Renaissance science were Italians, but students in France, England, Germany, and other countries soon took up the work of enlightenment. COPERNICUS 1473-1543 The names of some Renaissance scientists stand as landmarks in the history of thought. The first place must be given to Copernicus, the founder of modern astronomy. He was a Pole, but lived many years in Italy. Patient study and calculation led him to the conclusion that the earth turns upon its own axis, and, together with the planets, revolves around the sun. The book in which he announced this conclusion did not appear until the very end of his life. A copy of it reached him on his deathbed. THE COPERNICAN THEORY Medieval astronomers had generally accepted the Ptolemaic system. Some students before Copernicus had indeed suggested that the earth and planets might rotate about a central sun, but he first gave reasons for such a belief. The new theory met much opposition, not only in the universities, which clung to the time-honored Ptolemaic system, but also among theologians, who thought that it contradicted many statements in the Bible. Moreover, people could not easily reconcile themselves to the idea that the earth, instead of being the center of the universe, is only one member of the solar system, that it is, in fact, only a mere speck of cosmic dust. GALILEO, 1564-1642 An Italian scientist, Galileo, made one of the first telescopes--it was about as powerful as an opera glass--and turned it on the heavenly bodies with wonderful results. He found the sun moving unmistakably on its axis, Venus showing phases according to her position in relation to the sun, Jupiter accompanied by revolving moons, or satellites, and the Milky Way composed of a multitude of separate stars. Galileo rightly believed that these discoveries confirmed the theory of Copernicus. KEPLER, 1571-1630 Another man of genius, the German Kepler, worked out the mathematical laws which govern the movements of the planets. He made it clear that the planets revolve around sun in elliptical instead of circular orbits. Kepler's investigations afterwards led to the discovery of the principle of gravitation. VESALIUS, 1514-1564 AND HARVEY, 1578-1657 Two other scientists did epochal work in a field far removed from astronomy. Vesalius, a Fleming, who studied in Italian medical schools, gave to the world the first careful description of the human body based on actual dissection. He was thus the founder of human anatomy. Harvey, an Englishman, after observing living animals, announced the discovery of the circulation of the blood. He thereby founded human physiology. THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Vesalius, Harvey, and their fellow workers built up the scientific method. In the Middle Ages students had mostly been satisfied to accept what Aristotle and other philosophers had said, without trying to prove their statements. Kepler, for instance, was the first to disprove the Aristotelian idea that, as all perfect motion is circular, therefore the heavenly bodies must move in circular orbits. Similarly, the world had to wait many centuries before Harvey showed Aristotle's error in supposing that the blood arose in the liver, went thence to the heart, and by the veins was conducted over the body. The new scientific method rested on observation and experiment. Students learned at length to take nothing for granted, to set aside all authority, and to go straight to nature for their facts. As Lord Bacon, one of Shakespeare's contemporaries and a severe critic of the old scholasticism, declared, \"All depends on keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature, and so receiving their images simply as they are, for God forbid that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of the world.\" Modern science, to which we owe so much, is a product of the Renaissance.

            "NA NE\t3337703\tThe value of NYC housing construction starts more than doubled to $1.9 billion in the first half of 2012, hitting a four-year high. In contrast, the value of overall construction starts in the city dropped 16 percent year-over-year, according to a New York Building Congress report released Tuesday. McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge data shows that there were $6.6 billion worth of starts across all construction for the first six months this year, down from $7.9 billion for the same period in 2011. Building Congress president Richard Anderson attributed the dip in overall construction to the non-residential sector, which includes commercial office and retail buildings, public and private schools and cultural/entertainment venues. The value of started projects in this sector fell to $3.2 billion in the first half of 2012 after hitting $6.1 billion in the same six months the previous year. \"While there's no shortage of planned projects, especially in the office sector, we are lacking the type of job growth and confidence in the overall economy that is necessary to get these projects off the ground quickly,\" Anderson said in a statement. However, \"the numbers coming from the residential sector are very encouraging... If you go back to July of 2011, this sector has generated nearly $4 billion in new projects.\" The data covers all project starts in New York City, including new construction, alterations and renovations to existing structures. The numbers reflect the estimated value of each commenced project through the whole construction process. \n",

Best place to see the air show for cheap/free? I've been going to the CIAS for a few years now, but this year I can't justify the time or the expense when all I'm interested in is seeing the F-16 and F-18. Obviously you can see the aircraft approaching the demo area from just about anywhere in the city, but is there somewhere you can get a good view of the low passes without entering the CNE?

Went out with a friend a few years back and we were way too far out. The show is set up for the people on shore. I've also seen it from the top of the TD centre before the downtown got closed in by newer bigger buildings and while it was too far away you could see the plane do their turn arounds and set ups miles away. TTC to King and Jameson and walk down to the lake. Try to find a spot that hasn't been taken over for parking. Okay, it was better pre nimrod but still I prefer to be out on the water. Maybe I'm just antisocial or something. I trailer down and launch at parklawn. After the show I usually go for a bit of a tour so pulling out isn't an issue. Bring a lunch listen to some tunes and float around, may not be the 'best' seat in the house but it's still my favorite way to watch it. \n",
            "NA PB\t0274411\tSearch Have you guys been keeping up with the Tumblr page for Postcards from America ? Its been fun to see all of the posts and the difference in the work. In the middle of all of this, Sandy happened, and Gilles Peress made a detour to cover the aftermath. See more, here . Its the last day to back Per-Anders Pettersson s project, Soweto , so lets get on this. The rewards for backers are fantastic (a weekend workshop in Soweto with Per-Anders sounds amazing, but a signed print would be a nice compromise if you can't figure out how to get to South Africa right now). Soweto was recently featured on the Lens Blog . Soweto, or southwestern townships, was founded over one hundred years ago outside Johannesburg, South Africa, under British authority. It was established as the first settlement for black and colored people on the outskirts of the city. During that time Africans had been drawn to work on the gold mines near Johannesburg and were accommodated in separate areas on the outskirts of town. The growth of the township of Soweto was accelerated by the increasing eviction of Africans by city and state authorities under the Apartheid regime after 1948. Soweto grewto be the biggest township in the country. Far away from work and housing, the township consisted of hostels for men, simple huts and corrugated tin shacks. Today, Soweto is a development hub and consists of 32 townships and the official population is around one million. Many believe it's much higher, some think as high as 2-3 million. I worked in Soweto for the first time in 1994 while covering the first democratic elections. Soweto has always been my favorite part of Johannesburg. Soweto as a rich history and is infamous for the political violence during the Apartheid struggle. Of those the violent student uprisings in 1976 are maybe most known to foreigners, where students from the township rose up in protest against Afrikaans as the only language used in the education system. The South African regime answered to the protests by shooting at unarmed children dressed in their school uniforms. This event sparked a re-awakening of black resistance and many of the important developments at the time happened in the township. Many of the key players in the struggle era lived and operated out of Soweto. More than 30 years later Soweto is a city of growing enterprises and a wild mix of culture, with several high-end shopping malls, a brand new world class theater, car dealers, parks, improving transport and brand new townhouses and apartments that sell like hot cakes. I have been based in South Africa for the last 10 years and have always gone back to Soweto whenever I could on assignments or to see friends. I am fascinated with his fast changing pace and its growing prosperity. I am now planning to move to Soweto for a couple of months to complete my ongoing project about the rapid changes in South Africa's most famous township. Soweto is seen by many as a model of hope for the new South Africa. It is no longer a place of doom and gloom but a place of hope. It has of course its problems with high levels of poverty, unemployment and crime, but the positive developments are beginning to filter through. The few last years have brought a lot of investments to Soweto and many people now enjoy modern shopping malls, banks, restaurants and trendy bars. Many of the old shacks have been erased and thousands of small government subsidized houses have been built. Because of new investments, many residents of Soweto now start to spend most of their time and money in the township. Most of them still work in Johannesburg, but now they don't have to buy groceries and bring them back in mini bus taxis. More and more people have their own cars and buy everything close to their homes. Soweto has lately been in the midst of a property boom, where every property for sale has several potential buyers and it's usually sold within days. Many newly rich blacks left the township in the 90s for the northern suburbs, where traditionally only affluent whites lived. Many live there in mansions with high walls and tight security. Many only know their neighbors by name. It has been a difficult adjustment for most. Added problems are the high crime rate in affluent suburbs, such as hour breaking and car high-jacking. Many who left miss the vibrant life in the townships and they usually came back to visit on the weekends for family gatherings and funerals, or they just come to wash their new BMWs at a car wash, while having a few beers with their childhood friends in tendy bars. Soweto is increasingly a source for new fashion, art, music styles in South Africa. It is a great microcosm to show the many facets of the new South Africa. I would be very happy to share this journey with you! For serious supporters of this project I will offer a workshop in Soweto where we will live, work and breath in this massive, vibrant place closely. We will also work on a photo project and you will also be able to get a close and unique insight into how I work as a photojournalist. We will be completing projects and I will share my insight and experience of many years of working as a photojournalist around the world. -- Per-Anders Pettersson What started your interest in photography and what led you to photo editing? Well, I kinda fell into it. I dropped out of college and moved to New York, I was working a series of crappy food service jobs. A friend from high school was working at the Saba Agency in the library, refiling slides. I was working at a burrito joint working the takeout counter. I was miserable. When my pal decided to leave his job at Saba to be a waiter and I asked if he could get me in. He marched me into Marcel Saba's office and said \"I'm leaving, but my friend can work here.\" Marcel, surprisingly, said okay. I started refiling 35mm slides, then moved onto cataloguing, then editing, then helping out with production. I loved my job, loved looking at photos. I learned a lot working there with really great, talented people. When People magazine went published a photo of Audrey Hepburn that I researched, I was thrilled! My first job in publishing was with Marianne Butler at Worth . When she left for Men's Health , she took me with her. She really taught me a lot, she had a great eye and was a very exacting boss. Her photo pet peeves are now my pet peeves. I shudder at the word \"shooter\" and cropped out feet makes me crazy. What are some of the best, and hardest aspects of your job? Seeing a great photo is the best part of the job. I love being surprised, I love seeing a story/ portrait turn out different and better than I imagined. The hardest part is when the photo is just okay. All I can hear is that Debbie Downer sound when a shoot is less than expected. So basically its always Christmas. The main wall of Ernie's office. About the wall, Ernie says \"It's a mix of photo/images/people i like, my family and 2 percent cute boys.\" I'm sure you get tons of printed promos, emails and phone calls; what is the best way for a photographer to reach out to you and what are some common mistakes that are made? I don't get as many printed promos pieces anymore. When I do receive one that catches my eye, I'll always check the photographer's website. I do get lots of e-promos and generally just scan the embedded image and make a choice whether to click to the website. I'm more likely to check out the websites of photographer's outside of big cities. I do see a lot of great young photographers whose images are not appropriate for the work I produce -- that can be hard! I will sometimes send an email to let them know how much I admire their work. Promo mistakes... sigh... Always include your location! Photo editors need to know where you are located. If you are a regional photographer your promo should show a wider variety of images, i.e. portraits, reportage... I tend to pass over promo pieces with one image of: landscapes, puppies, children, flowers, a celebrity holding a puppy or a flower... When you get a shoot in, what is your editing process? Do you go by your gut reaction to an image or is your edit based on the text or what your editor has asked for? When a shoot comes in I just go through and make a selects of photos that I like, and then try to strong arm the designers into using the photo that I like best! We work very closely with our editors on the art direction so when the shoot happens all the edit notes have been incorporated into the shoot direction. Photograph by Meredith Jenks Ernie Monteiro started working in photo in the waning days of the age of chrome. She has worked at Worth, Men's Health and is currently at Time Inc. Content Solutions, the custom publishing arm of Time Inc. The amazing Stephen Wilkes will be featured on one of my favorite shows, CBS Sunday Morning (why yes, I am an 85-year-old-gentleman, and proud of it!) this weekend. The focus will be on his Day to Night series and the making of the photographs. If you are lazing about in your pajamas be sure to watch it, Stephen is pretty incredible and inspiring, I can't wait to see it! Aside from photography, were there any other professions that interested you? I started out with the desire to be a computer scientist. Then I explored city planning.  I discovered photography while I was in college, and was inspired to finally find an appropriate tool to simultaneously illustrate the complexities of society and the intricacies of being a human.  I am challenged by the desire to illustrate a clear picture that intertwines both emotion and reality into a method of communication that is understood.  I saw images by Dorthea Lange and felt that images she created were more significant than most anything else in illustrating the dilemma in the U.S. during the Dust Bowl; photography could be a significant and powerful communication tool in society. How influential and beautiful a profession to be able to introduce that level of conversation to the world. Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Can you tell me more about your project The Middle Road Which you worked on during the last election. What gave you the idea, how long did you spend shooting and are you curious to revisit those spots again and see if those candidate signs have changed? I'm actually writing this from the road. I left the west coast to follow the same route as I did in 2008 to explore and add depth to the project.  This time I'll be photographing this route twice -- to NY and back.   The interesting twist this time is Sandy. Sandy is the deadly weather event that cancelled my flight east at the beginning of this project, and created havoc for just about everyone on the east coast.  I was supposed to land in Newark on October 28th, the night before the hurricane reached landfall there.  For a while I was unsure if this project was doomed or if there was still a way to make it happen within the limited time available before the election on November 6th, or if the project mattered _at all_ in the scheme of things.  But, here we are, on the road- Day 7 will take us in and out of post-Sandy New York City. The trip in 2008 was a little bit spontaneous.  I came up with the concept when driving from Las Vegas to the Bay Area in late summer 2008 after spotting a Ron Paul sign alongside the freeway in the desert.  The sparseness of the landscape with this sign plopped in the middle; it seemed so insignificant- this name, this sign, politics against the backdrop of the desert sun.  Simultaneously, the radio was underlining the importance of each candidate and how this election was different.  Friends were excitedly arguing about politics. I felt buried beneath this big political bubble and sensed a disconnect signaled by this Ron Paul sign beneath a bright blue sky; the sign almost looked like a piece of garbage left there.  I passed by it once more with the intention of photographing it, and discovered the challenges that came along with photographing signs along a busy freeway. I never got a shot.  But I thought that photographing signs related directly to the two major candidates throughout the United States would make an interesting story if I was able to explore multiple signs in multiple places.  Adding to the depth, stick to a main corridor that divides the country in two -- kind of the way politics seems to divide people into the us and the them; the haves and the have-nots; the right and the left; the rich and the poor; the right and the wrong. There are all these dualities, and then there's the middle road. Several weeks went by and I didn't share my idea with anyone.  Surprisingly, a close friend of mine called me up out of the blue; she had bought a house across the country in Upstate New York to escape the Bay Area for a while. She would be moving sometime in October and needed a driving partner.  Our explorations and teamwork during that trip created the images from 2008.  I wasn't sure how it was going to work out, and then I got the film back. There's something special about photographing the country in the way that I did during that time.  It's a different time now, though it's still quite a powerful time- with much confusion and disappointment and strife.  I feel like this part of the story was missing from 2008. I don't intend to photograph any elections in the future. The 2012 images serve as a bookend to the 2008 images. Interestingly, we are all driven to see similarities or differences in the settings for each sign; we are drawn to trying to find a pattern. Are the signs for the Republican candidate all in rich neighborhoods or on farms? Sometimes.  Is the Democratic sign in front of the working family's little house? Sometimes.  From the road, it is hard to notice a pattern other than the obvious increase in Democratic signage in metropolitan areas.  That is the single noticeable pattern.  All else is unpredictable in terms of the signs that I am looking for. I don't keep numbers, I'm just looking for good photographs. I'm looking for a wide breadth of things that tie in classic American stories, images that illustrate the American landscape on a variety of levels, images that bring me back to that disconnect introduced by the Ron Paul sign in the desert. \n",

The wave of Japanese victories, ending with the capture of the Netherlands East Indies in March 1942, left in its wake a mass of Allied prisoners of war, including many Australians. Most of the Australians (14,972) were captured in Singapore; other principal Australian prisoner-of-war groups were captured in Java (2,736), Timor (1,137), Ambon (1,075), and New Britain (1,049). At the end of the war Australian prisoners of war were widely distributed: 5,549 on Singapore Island and in Johore (Malaya); 4,830 in Burma and Thailand; 265 in French-Indo China; 385 on Java; 243 on Sumatra; 100 on Ambon; 2 on Macassar; 7 on Bali; 150 at Kuching (British North Borneo); 2,700 distributed between Japan, Korea, and Manchuria; and 200 on Hainan Island.

            "OP OB\t3281556\tHow should retail investors own gold? Mostly physical metal, some quality mining majors (avoid the indices), and ETFs only for trading Is gold in a bubble? No Could gold get re-monetized? Quite possibly Where is gold flowing? From the West to the East. At some point, capital controls will be put in place What the politicians are doing is the exact opposite of what they need to be doing . We continue adding to our debt, we continue raising the debt ceiling, we continue deficit spending, we continue borrowing money, and, of course, we continue printing money. We are doing the exact opposite of all the things that would lead us away from inflation. So yes, I think that is an important point. I will add that inflation has occurred very quickly, very rapidly, very suddenly many times in the past , just in recent history. If you look back at the high inflationary times, just in the past 100 years here in the U.S., many of those that hit 12%, 14%, 15% -- two years prior to then, the CPI was completely benign. It was 1%, 2% -- I think at one point it was 4% -- and then all of a sudden within 24 months, it was 12%, 14%. So it can happen very suddenly, and my fear is that is what is going to happen this time. People are in a lull; no one is expecting it: the CPI is low; nothing is really happening with all this money printing; there has been no fallout. But I think that is the critical point. You cannot do these kinds of things we are doing forever and not experience any consequences. Sooner or later there are going to be consequences to what we are doing, and my fear is that it is going to be nasty, catch a lot of people off guard , and really hurt our society. The bottom line for me is, that is why I am buying gold and silver, still, to this day. For these reasons and others, Jeff strongly believes everyone should have exposure to gold and silver as a defense for preserving the purchasing power of their weath. The key question is: how much exposure? You want to focus on how many ounces you own , not necessarily looking at whether the price is $5 higher today than it was yesterday. How many ounces do you own? That is really the question you want to ask yourself, so you can focus on how much you are really going to need, and the amount really comes down to this. For me, I am probably going to use some of this gold if we get high inflation. How are you going to protect your standard of living if we get some kind of runaway inflation? And let's say it's not runaway hyperinflation; let's just say it's high inflation, 10%, 15%. Remember it was 14% in 1980, so the odds of us getting high inflation are realistic. So if I am going to use that gold to cover my standard of living, you are going to need about two thirds of an ounce of gold for every thousand dollars of monthly expenses . If you want to protect your standard of living and not have your house be ravaged by inflation, so to speak, so that is a good guideline to follow. So if inflation lasts a couple years, well, you are going to need 15 ounces of gold for every thousand dollars of monthly expenses. That is a good guideline to think about. And if your expenses are more per month, you are going to need more gold than that. If inflation lasts longer than two years, you are going to need more than that, but you can actually use the sales of gold and silver to protect your standard of living. You sell some gold and silver, you are going to get U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars with it and you can use the increase in the gold and silver price to offset the increase in the goods and services you are buying. So I think that is the way to view it, to look at how you are going to use it. And so the focus again comes back to how many ounces do you own? So if you do not have any, you need to obviously start buying. Here are two tables -- one for gold and the other for silver -- Jeff offers in his newsletter to help investors calculate the requisite ounces needed to protect against rising inflation over time: The point here is that you're probably going to need more ounces than you think. Look at your bank statement and assess how much you spend each month -- and do it honestly. The other part of the equation is how long we'll need to use gold and silver to cover those expenses. The potential duration of high inflation will dictate how much physical bullion we need stashed away. This is also probably longer than you think; in Weimar Germany, high inflation lasted two years -- and then hyperinflation hit and lasted another two. Four years of high inflation. That's not kindling -- that's a wildfire roaring through your back yard. So here's how much gold you'll need, depending on your monthly expenses and how long high inflation lasts. Ounces of Gold Needed to Meet Expenses During High Inflation Monthly expenses in US dollars Monthly expenses in gold, oz* Inflation Duration 6 months 1 year 18 months 2 years 3 years 4 years 5 years $500 0.31 1.9 3.7 5.6 7.5 11.2 15.0 18.7 $1,000 0.63 3.8 7.5 11.3 15.0 22.5 30.0 37.5 $2,000 1.25 7.5 15.0 22.5 30.0 45.0 60.0 75.0 $3,000 1.88 11.3 22.5 33.8 45.0 67.5 90.0 112.5 $4,000 2.50 15.0 30.0 45.0 60.0 90.0 120.0 150.0 $5,000 3.13 18.8 37.5 56.3 75.0 112.5 150.0 187.5 $10,000 6.25 37.5 75.0 112.5 150.0 225.0 300.0 375.0 $20,000 12.50 75.0 150.0 225.0 300.0 450.0 600.0 750.0 *Based on $1,600 gold price If my monthly expenses are about $3,000/month, I need 45 ounces to cover two years of high inflation, and 90 if it lasts four years. Those already well off should use the bottom rows of the table. How much will you need? Of course many of us own silver, too. Here's how many ounces we'd need, if we saved in silver. Ounces of Silver Needed to Meet Expenses During High Inflation Monthly expenses in US dollars Monthly expenses in silver, oz* Inflation Duration 6 months 1 year 18 months 2 years 3 years 4 years 5 years $500 17.9 107.1 214.2 321.3 428.4 642.6 856.8 1,071.0 $1,000 35.7 214.3 428.5 642.8 857.0 1,285.6 1,714.1 2,142.6 $2,000 71.4 428.5 857.0 1,285.6 1,714.1 2,571.1 3,428.2 4,285.2 $3,000 107.1 642.8 1,285.7 1,928.5 2,571.4 3,857.0 5,142.7 6,428.4 $4,000 142.9 857.1 1,714.2 2,571.3 3,428.4 5,142.6 6,856.8 8,571.0 $5,000 178.6 1,071.4 2,142.8 3,214.3 4,285.7 6,428.5 8,571.4 10,714.2 $10,000 357.1 2,142.6 4,285.0 6,427.8 8,570.4 1,2855.6 17,140.8 21,426.0 $20,000 714.3 4,285.7 8,571.4 12,857.0 17,142.7 25,714.1 34,285.4 42,856.8 *Based on $28 silver price A $3,000 monthly budget needs 1,285 ounces to get through one year, or 3,857 ounces for three years. I know these amounts probably sound like a lot. But here's the thing: if you don't save now in gold and silver, you're going to spend a whole lot more later. What I've outlined here is exactly what gold and silver are for: to protect your purchasing power, your standard of living. Jeff discusses the Hard Assets Alliance as a solution worth considering when purchasing bullion. For more information on the HAA can be found here. Click the play button below to listen to Chris' interview with Jeff Clark (46m:01s): This article was clearly written by someone who's never lived through a long period of hyperinflation.  You don't spend gold or silver. You become a snake, you sit and wait. You adapt your life to spend your income immediately, and you wait, and wait, and wait some more for the strike opportunity.  As people become more and more under stress, valuable assets come up on the cheap in terms of gold/silver.  That's when you grab them up.  Notice that people are happy to sell them to you--the bankers have destroyed their lifes and they need the hard money more than anything else. If you think you're going to spend gold/silver on a monthly basis, you'll only be painting a huge target on your back, and your stash will be clear to everyone. DoChen has a different way of looking at how much gold to own (I will limit my remarks here to gold, if possible EVERYONE here ought to own silver IN ADDITION to the gold). There are +/- 6 billion oz of gold, approx. one oz per person in the world.  If we stipulate that Americans are 5 - 10 times \"wealthier\" (hey just sayin', OK?), then each American ought to own at least 5 - 10 oz each. So, a family of three should own from 15 - 30 oz of gold. That is the average American (family). I would guess that your \"average\" ZH-er should own AT LEAST TWICE the above. \" : the CPI is low; nothing is really happening with all this money printing; there has been no fallout. But I think that is the critical point. You cannot do these kinds of things we are doing forever and not experience any consequences\" IMO the secret to Gold & Silver in a major crash followed by a Depression is simple. Dig a hole and forget about it. Go through the pain like everyone else. Then, once the dust is settling, dig up your stash and buy that which reboots the economy or survival process. You need to think about the uplift AFTER the storm, when money converges again. Yes, Gold can/will reduce pain, but you're spending something which has far more purchasing power if you can hold-off till the right time. Why hedge inflation when there's a 100-1000 bagger for your kids. Yes, a weird article that.  Apparently, Mr & Mrs with the 3 kids will just start using the 'gold card' once the digits start revolving like a slot-machine on prices & just carry on as before. IMHO, when high or hyper inflation starts (and assuming you're comfortable in PMs) you batten down the hatches & make sure your fiat buys (other) useful stuff - storable food, tools, materiel etc. The putative spenders in the above article would just keep going to Wendy's, the Mall & multiplex as 'normal' - a bit like people in trauma shock or something. The ability to pick up substantial goods/materiel (in the latter stages) & when a good opportunity presents - can be the use of PMs , not buying bacon butties & plastic crap like the money's burning a hole in your pocket. Blessed with a strong army but most importantly knowledge of Rome's financial troubles Constantine waltzed into Rome while his troops stayed at the City-State's gates.  He met with the priest class who gave the King's their crowns and informed them that he knew they were broke and that the Treasury had been looted.  He gave them two choices:  name him God's chosen ruler of Rome and her lands or he would bring his troops in and take it. In exchange they would work together to form a new religion, one true religion.  The priest class and he would form the Church and rule together.  The priest class agreed knowing full well they did not have the funds to fight back and must have liked the idea of having one God to collect charity in the name of. This is the power of knowledge and money - when you have them you are on the hill and when you don't you are fighting a losing battle. Your comment could have comprised the entire article.  Since gold has infinite marginal utility, one should own as much as can be had... period.   All computations will, as do strategies, fail after the first battle with inflation. As you see the tables assume a $1600 price. I would assume that my foresight at buying gold years ago with all this in mind also included the idea that gold would outperform as would silver. As such the amount of ounces projected here to survive are vastly overstated.  I would assume as hyperinflation hits gold/silver will also increase in value (probably out-pace inflation many fold).  So this is good to get one thinking but really does not answer the question of how many ounces are adequate. I think you have to put this in perspective as it assumes we are all millionaires already who can afford thousands of ounces of gold with the idea that all we are going to do is stand still. This chart is simplistic in that it assumes you have no income flow and have been unable to prepare for some of this in advance. Fer instance 1.5 years ago I watched the futures markets on various agri goods. I bought up every sale on large cans of coffee on sale. I hae 24 months of cheap coffee that is now 4 times the price on the shelf. Inflation is already here and one must be astute by protecting your family through more than ounces of silver and gold. I am still of the mind that I will pay off my debts with devalued fiat that will come from my gold/silver sales. Got all the food etc. stashed already for a 2 year run. At least I will be able to cost average any future purchases I need. But then I am a woman who looks at the real inflation judge; which is the supermarkets. Whacko, well stated as those were my exact thoughts as I read it. My advise is buy as much silver/gold as your budget can withstand and stack it for the safety of having your hedge against all future issues. In The Economics of Inflation: A Study of Currency Depreciation in Post-War Germany, by Constantino Bresciani-Turroni, he had a table showing the real value of assets and goods at the end of the inflation. Stocks and real estate gained some value, but gold was at the top of the list at 200, in other words, gold doubled in real value again everything else. The only people who will need to spend gold to finance their standard of living are retired people with no other assets.How many broke ass retired people have a stash of gold? Anyone with income would be wise to accept a drop in their standard of living and use the gold to buy assets. It's stupid to spend your gold to keep your standard of living flat during hyperinflation, when you could at the very least double (and probably triple or quadruple) your standard of living on the other side by holding gold and swapping it for cheap assets during the inflation. This is a dumb article.  If the scenarios he outlines happen why would he be out spending his money as capital as if it were money as income at such an inopportune time? Actually, there is no opportune time. The long story short of it it that you go from hard assets into cash flowing, leverageable assets, and wait.  Basically buy something like real estate, wait for normalization, and you will not be worrying about cannibalizing your nut during the transition.  People that did this in argentina with dollars made out like bandits when the economy could releverage itself. And, in the case you actuallt need to use metal to barter, keep some silver dimes around.  I cant wait to sell a bag of beans to this retard when he brings his krugerrands to the farmers market.  And being prepared to not run out of food staples in the first place will cost a lot less than 700 oz of gold right now. \" If anybody has any idea of hoarding our silver coins, let me say this. Treasury has a lot of silver on hand, and it can be, and it will be used to keep the price of silver in line with its value in our present silver coin. There will be no profit in holding them out of circulation for the value of their silver content\" Lyndon B. Johnson Statement of the FedGov's interest in supressing the price of silver? I believe they moved into creating paper markets (oil, gold, silver, wheat, corn) to make price manipulation easier - no need to worry about dishoarding physical into the market when you can dump paper to depress prices. There are a few things here I have a problem with. I don't think we get high/hyper inflation with stagnating/declining wages. If we somehow get massive wage growth and hyperinflate then my monthly mortgage payment (which is mine, and I assume many on here's biggest expense) becomes a very small problem. It's the variable costs (food, fuel) that get out of hand. But those are the expenses I assume people are actually saving in metals to protect against. It's the scenario he presents that I fear the most. Inflation at high levels but not high enough to blow a hole in the fed. Some nasty ass stagflation or biflationary scenario (Spain/Italy) that drains people of their PM's as they fight to keep their head above water. Then PM's really did not serve that much of a purpose after all. Well, HAD they enough of it saved it would, correct?. 9 of 10 families likely had NO AU or Silver stashes, they just sold off family jewelry. Most had NO clue how really bad it was going to be,when this crap hits(like Hyper-inflation first, then deflation), in crappy times, as he shows just a glimmer 3%, to 20%.....................that isn't close to Hyper. Read jsmineset.com articles today on this very issue, and check out the scenario in place during Weimar.................blow your mind,how fast it hit, and things were crappy BEFORE it did. What is scary is that most of the sheep have already hocked whatever scrap gold they may have had laying around, and blew that cash ages ago on bills or food or booze or some chinese made trinket or two.  They will be the victims of the upcoming economic Frankenstorm that is already on the radar and marching it's way towards America.  The howling and yammering will be loud and unceasing. For those 1% of us who are stacking, you should also be thinking ahead and planning about how you can reduce your future expenses and preserve your stack.  Count on government to want to take as much as it can from you, and then some.  Expect the unexpected such as crushing energy costs, outrageous property tax hikes, new assesments, increased garbage collection rates, local sales tax hikes, and increased fines and fees for everything...especially if your living in the northeast.   Hopefully you will have something left from your stack once the Great Reset is over.  If your close to retirement, George Carlin will be proven right...they are going to come after your Social Security and probably your pension and in the system savings as well if your lucky enough to have some. There's already the beginnings of capital controls starting in the uk. Overseas pension transfers have recently been tightened to the point of a vigorous wedgie and the requirements for reporting are more bureaucratic than a socialist's convention. It's on its way for sure. Thing is, most of us have never lived through truly hard times with Hooverville type depression, so we really don't know yet how bad it will be, and our debt levels are a quantum sprung higher than anything experienced during the 1930's. If we get a Greece or Spain scenaro within the US, there will be chaos....and Road Warriors.

            "NA NE\t0723677\tFamed railway leader Hunter Harrison said he is \"excited\" about the prospect of running another freight carrier, this time former rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. \"I am eager for another opportunity,\" Mr. Harrison told The Globe and Mail in an exclusive interview Tuesday from his family home in Wellington, Fla., his first public comments since he emerged as a candidate to run the historic Canadian company. Streetwise Transportation Mr. Harrison, who is credited with transforming industry laggard Canadian National Railway Co. into North America's most admired and efficient railway, has been put forward as a potential chief executive officer for Canadian Pacific by New York fund manager Bill Ackman, CP's largest shareholder. Mr. Ackman has launched a battle to gain control of the board, saying the company can be run with lower costs -- and that Mr. Harrison is the man to make that happen. When approached last fall by Mr. Ackman about the possibility of leading CP, Mr. Harrison said he realized that \"passion and enthusiasm\" have been missing from his life since he retired in 2009 as CEO of Montreal-based CN. Mr. Harrison, 67, said he has missed the bustle of the corporate world despite his new life as a company director and owner and trainer of show horses. He said he is in \"great health\" after heart bypass surgery in 1998, and his wife Jeannie and his doctor agree that he is more suited for work than retirement. \"I feel like I can still make a significant contribution. If the opportunity presents it itself, I am ready to go,\" he said. If he gets the job at CP, it would rank as one of the corporate sector's more dramatic comebacks. Mr. Harrison is past retirement age and would be running CN's archrival. Any turnaround at CP would potentially come at the expense of Mr. Harrison's former employer, where he was CEO from 2003 to 2009, and chief operating officer before that under Paul Tellier. Mr. Harrison said he is not troubled by the prospect of competing against a company that employed him for more than 11 years. He said a non-compete agreement that restricted him from joining a CN competitor expired last month and the two national Canadian railways do not \"compete head to head\" because only about a quarter of their tracks operate in similar locations. \"I left [CN]in good shape. I fulfilled my responsibilities. I think that two strong rail systems in Canada are good for everybody. I don't think a strong CP hurts CN,\" he said. At CN, he regularly exhorted employees to work harder at sessions that became known as Hunter Camps; he compelled freight customers to follow fixed train schedules; and he kept a constant eye on the company's rail network through special television screens installed in his home. As CN sped ahead, CP was left behind and today ranks as the least efficient of the Big Six railways. But whether Mr. Harrison's makes it to the executive suite at CP depends on the outcome of a battle between Mr. Ackman and the railway's board of directors, each of whom must persuade investors of their vision for the company. The activist investor is currently soliciting candidates for an alternative slate of directors that would likely be put to a shareholder vote at the company's expected annual meeting in May. Days after he acquired what is now a 14.2 per cent stake in CP in October, Mr. Ackman flew from his home in New York to meet with the company's directors in Montreal to propose replacing incumbent CEO Fred Green with Mr. Harrison. On Monday, CP's chairman John Cleghorn issued a public letter supporting Mr. Green and rejecting the appointment of Mr. Harrison as \"detrimental\" to the company's efforts to modernize its fleet and rail networks. A number of industry analysts have praised Mr. Harrison as a \"compelling\" candidate for CEO. \"His experience running CN ... is ideal to apply to improving CP, in our view,\" JPMorgan analyst Thomas Wadewitz wrote in a report this week. \"[It]may prove difficult for CP's board to sustain a fight against the appointment of Mr. Harrison as CEO.\" If he takes the driver's seat at CP, Mr. Harrison said he would adopt many of the same strategies that worked for CN and before that Illinois Central Railroad. He said his priority would be to \"change the culture\" at a railway that blames its poor performance on geography, weather and terrain. In recent months, CP has blamed unusually difficult winter and spring flooding conditions for operating problems and poor financial results. It also attributes poor operating efficiencies to the steep mountain grades its trains must travel through. \"I don't buy into those excuses,\" Mr. Harrison said, because \"you are always going to have weather in Canada. \"You are not going to change the mountains, the rivers or the geography of things. You have what you have and you got to deal with them the best you can and develop a plan and move forward.\" Photos Enjoy the convenience of having The Globe and Mail delivered right to your door, your mobile phone and computer.

On Saturday night Strictly Come Dancing attracted 10.4 million viewers, half a million more than tuned in to the same show last year. In comparison The X Factor drew an average viewing audience of only 8.4 million, compared to an average of around 11 million people at this stage of the contest in 2011. Bosses are hoping to turn things around by featuring more performances from celebrity acts on the Saturday night, as well as the Sunday live shows, however this ploy didn't work when they had One Direction on last weekend.

            "OP OB\t3210648\tEssays on economic crisis, decoding dominant ideologies and creating a better world Cooperation is not only a good idea, it already works in practice Cooperation is a fundamental human trait. You may find it bizarre to read a post that begins with such a sentence, but sometimes we do have to point out the obvious. Competition, we are continually lectured, is the primary driving force animating human beings. It is rarely, if ever, put quite so explicitly, but the prevailing ideology does tell us exactly that. Competition is the fuel of economic growth and progress in a system based on never-ending life-and-death fights to gain dominance at pain of going out of business -- so we are told. Competition, conveniently, can be won by only a few heroic figures, who must be given control over other peoples' lives and rewarded with stratospheric pay. We lowly employees, who can not comprehend the divine will of the market (which is governed by an invisible hand that only the chosen few of the business elite can see because they possess the magic glasses that see what is otherwise invisible), must sit in awe and gratitude of our capitalist masters. In fact, we should turn over the workings of our entire government to them, and be grateful for their selfless attitude in leaving the business world behind so that they can change the laws to benefit the businesses to which they will return. Yes, I am going to commit sacrilege here. The world of the preceding two paragraphs, despite their continual propagation, does not have to be so. Places where they aren't so already exist. Human beings can cooperate with one another (and routinely do -- how would a product or service exist if employees did not work together?). The following is by no means a comprehensive list of successful cooperative enterprises, but represent building blocks toward a different way of organization. Cooperative enterprises, in which all employees share in all the decision-making and manage themselves, are not pie in the sky. They already exist. Cooperatives are distinguished by higher pay than received by employees in traditional businesses, and studies have shown greater levels of job satisfaction -- neither is a surprise when large sums of money are not funneled upward and workers have control and decision-making power over their jobs. The recovered factories of Argentina Practical experience in Argentina, where cooperatives have existed in a variety of industries since 2001, has provided a demonstration of worker-run enterprises forging strong links with their communities, with mutual benefit to the enterprise and the community that supports the enterprise.* Solidarity and community instincts have not disappeared under the stress of competition from the capitalism surrounding Argentine cooperatives. A high level of idealism was necessary to initiate the process and in turn the experience has raised consciousness to new levels. After an upsurge in new occupations in 2009 (the latest year for which I can find a reliable figure), the Argentine movement of worker recovery of factories encompassed about 250 enterprises with more than 13,000 workers. The factory takeovers came in the wake of economic collapse a decade ago . Nstor Kirchner, upon taking office as president early in 2002, suspended Argentina's foreign-debt payments before agreeing to pay only 30 percent of the crippling debt, an unusual example of a country standing up to the capitalist world's multi-national financial institutions. But Kirchner and his wife and successor as president, Cristina Fernndez, did almost nothing internally to disturb the workings of capitalism -- Argentina's worker-run factories have contended with hostility from domestic political authorities and from corporate power inside and outside the country. Most of the cooperatives formed in the worker-run factories began with similar stories -- owners failing to pay employees, owners stripping the enterprises of assets, owners shutting down plants with no notice and of police using force to expel workers who had occupied plants for the purpose of getting some of the back pay owed to them after production was halted. The cooperatives were formed when workers maintaining their occupations realized that their factory owner did not intend to restart production, and decided to restart production themselves. The employees doing so first had to overcome their own doubts about themselves, but were able to draw on the experience of those who went first and created national organizations to represent the cooperatives and enable coordination among them. The president of the national coordinating body National Movement of Reclaimed Companies, Eduardo Mura, explained this process in an interview published in the book Sin Patrn : \"Since the restoration of democracy [after the 1976-1983 military dictatorship], all the laws that have been passed are against workers' rights. The laws, enacted first by the dictatorship and then by the formal democracy, served to consolidate a global economic model organized according to the [existing capitalist] international division of labor. The changes to the bankruptcy law, for example, had left us without the possibility of severance pay. The reformed law also requires the judge to liquidate a bankrupt company's assets in 120 days. The only way to reclaim the company is to occupy it and show, first the judge, and then the political class, that we're not going to leave the factory. ... Certainly, if there weren't so many doubts and fears among the entire working class, there would be many more reclaimed factories. Because of these uncertainties, this process only works in places where there is some level of organization and capable leadership.\" [pages 214-215] The largest of these reclaimed factories is the Zann factory producing ceramic tiles, which is now known as FaSinPat, a contraction of the Spanish-language words meaning \"Factory Without a Boss.\"?The process started when the original owner, Luis Zann, stopped paying his employees, who went on strike in response. Zann received loans from the provincial government to pay back wages, but pocketed the money instead. Finally, the employees went back in, occupied the silent factory, sought and received community support, and decided to restart production themselves in March 2002. Despite legal obstacles and police harassment, the collective works. In the first four years of worker self-management, the number of employees increased from 300 to 470, wages and factory output increased, and without the speedups and insensitivity to safety imposed by bosses, accident rates were reduced 90 percent. New workers are not hired hands, but become part of the collective. The collective allies itself with the struggle of local Indigenous peoples, who have donated clay from their lands to the factory. The collective also donates tiles to community centers and hospitals and, in return, the nurses' union donates the services of a nurse during each shift. The path of the FaSinPat collective was not an easy one -- the workers had to physically defend their occupation, with community assistance, more than once and they had to wait eight years before the provincial government passed a law granting the collective legal control of the factory in August 2009. The government also paid off part of the debt incurred by Luis Zann -- much of it owed to the World Bank, which gave a loan of 20 million dollars to Zann for the construction of the plant, a loan he never paid back. Zann's creditors had pushed for the eviction of the collective and foreclosure of the plant during the months leading up to the legislative vote. The cooperatives operate in a myriad of Argentine industries, including \"white collar\" businesses. One example is a speciality newspaper covering economic and judicial issues in Crdoba. The newspaper, Comercio y Justcia , was sold by its long-time family owners to a conglomerate during the 1990s wave of corporate consolidation of Argentine media. The new corporate owners hired managers at enormous salaries, stopped paying employee salaries and staged a fake robbery that emptied the office of most of its equipment. The workers brought in their own computers so the newspaper could continue to publish, then went on strike when the new owners failed to pay them for five months. Finally, the workers went back in to restart the newspaper themselves, making it a going concern after a great struggle. In contrast to other media outlets cutting staff and quality, the Comercio y Justcia collective maintained the size of its staff and its quality, more than doubling circulation in its first year. In almost all of the Argentine cooperatives everybody earns the same amount, and none hires outside managers -- the cooperatives are governed by assemblies of the entire workforce with their decisions carried out by managers who are elected from their own ranks and who serve limited, specified terms. In a separate interview in Sin Patrn , one of the Comercio y Justcia collective members said of the new way of working: \"Inside, we have a setup that goes against the logic of capitalism. A humanized work rgime, a production arrangement decided by workers themselves. In relationships outside the institution, we can't detach ourselves from the economy's logic, but we give ourselves the luxury of doing work for free and doing what we decide as workers. On the inside the revolution has already happened. And looking externally, our biggest contribution is demonstrating that workers can efficiently run an enterprise.\" [page 208] Not all the Argentines who recovered their abandoned companies initially wanted to form cooperatives -- there were those who wished for nationalization. There was no interest on the part of the federal or provincial governments to take over factories, so those workforces that initially sought nationalization had no choice but to adopt the cooperative form. Proponents of nationalization argued that cooperatives would be at the mercy of an intact capitalist system and that the cooperatives would eventually be forced to pay the old owner for the recovered factory, an expense they would be unable to meet. Proponents of cooperatives argued that direct worker takeovers would be faster and more practical -- the jobs would be saved faster this way, the aim of the takeovers. The cooperatives -- although many successfully bought their factories from the old owners at discounted prices thanks to strong community support and their perseverance through long legal battles and repeated attempts at physical expulsion -- remain small islands in a vast sea of capitalism. They are merely tolerated by an Argentine establishment loath to appear too openly to challenge continuing community support, and they represent an example that capitalists everywhere wish to stamp out. These cooperatives must survive in an economic environment that operates on a very different basis than they do and are at the mercy of the powerful forces unleashed by that environment, including boom/bust economic cycles. But they have survived. Mondragon, the world's biggest cooperative Based in the Basque Country of northern Spain, Mondragon has more than 83,000 jobs among its many businesses. Mondragon produces industrial components and consumer goods, provides construction services, and operates a supermarket chain, a bank and a university. These are not small operations -- the cooperative reports annual revenue of nearly 15 billion euros. New workers become full members after a trial period of six to twelve months. All ownership is in the hands of Mondragon workers; each buys one non-transferable share upon become a member and sells it back to the collective upon leaving or retiring. In addition to the regular wage, members also share in the profits, with a dividend being paid to each out of the surplus the members' business earns. Thirty to seventy percent of the profits are distributed as dividends, depending on the health of a given business. Profits are also distributed among the individual businesses, set aside for investment and to replenish reserves, and distributed into the overall organization's internal support fund. Mondragon's English-language web site explains the basis of its workers' renumeration, which are on a very different principle than a capitalist corporation: \"Labour is granted full sovereignty in the organisation of the co-operative enterprise, the wealth created is distributed in terms of the labour provided and there is a firm commitment to the creation of new jobs. As far as the wealth generated by the co-operative is concerned, this is distributed among the members in proportion to their labour and not on the basis of their holding in Share Capital. The pay policy of Mondragon's co-operatives takes its inspiration from principles of Solidarity, which are expressed through sufficient remuneration for labour on the basis of solidarity.\" All decisions on working hours, pay, allowable pay differentials, strategic decisions and management are made by a collective vote off all members. The supreme body of Mondragon is the general assembly, in which all members participate and vote on the basis of \"one member, one vote.\" The general assembly elects the governing council, which represents and governs the cooperative -- and is accountable to the general assembly. The governing council in turn appoints the executive management team. Management does not act independently, however -- a separate cooperative congress, consisting of 650 members delegated by individual businesses, is tasked with \"establish[ing] the strategic criteria by which the Corporation is to be administered.\" Members are also represented in all internal bodies by the social council, and an elected monitoring commission ensures compliance with accounting principles. Decision-making power, however, resides with the full membership. According to Mondragon: \"The first and foremost body of participation is the General Assembly, in which rests the full sovereignty of the co-operative. Its most important powers include: appointing and revoking members of the Governing Council and Accounts Auditors by means of a secret vote; examining company management, approving the annual accounts and the distribution of surplus and apportioning of losses; approving the general policies and strategies of the co-operative; approving increases in share capital, the rate of interest to be accrued by capital contributions and the joining fees for new members; modifying the Company Statutes and approving everything implied by a substantial modification in the economic, organisational or functional structure of the co-operative.\" Management comes from within; it is not hired from outside. And there are no layoffs -- if a business experiences a slowdown, some of its members are transferred to another business that has need of more workers. Mondragon, however egalitarian its internal structure, does have to compete in a capitalist environment against capitalist enterprises, and so continues to expand into new ventures and to, outside of Spain, buy companies. The latter are bought with an eye toward converting them into cooperatives and making the bought companies' personnel worker/owners equal to those in established businesses, but has not succeeded in converting all. Nonetheless, Mondragon's workers don't face the continual prospect of being laid off every time there is a slight dip in profits. Georgia Kelly and Shaula Massena, writing in Yes magazine, reported on what happened when one of the Mondragon businesses experienced difficult times: \"The worker/owners and the managers met to review their options. After three days of meetings, the worker/owners agreed that 20 percent of the workforce would leave their jobs for a year, during which they would continue to receive 80 percent of their pay and, if they wished, free training for other work. This group would be chosen by lottery, and if the company was still in trouble a year later, the first group would return to work and a second would take a year off. The result? The solution worked and the company thrives to this day.\" Nobody votes to send their jobs to a low-wage haven in another country. The \"Cleveland model\" starts with anchors The Evergreen Cooperative Initiative -- often referred to as the \"Cleveland model\" -- seeks to strengthen a local community from the ground up through the creation of cooperative enterprises anchored to large institutions. Based on the east side of Cleveland, Ohio -- a city that has lost half of its population since 1960 --  Evergreen creates worker-owned small businesses that provide products and services to established \"anchor\" institutions in the immediate area (such as hospitals and universities) and other customers. The Evergreen Cooperative Corporation, which describes itself as a holding company \"leading this initiative,\" says on its web site : \"The Evergreen Cooperative Initiative is based on a vision of 'community wealth building.' Community wealth strategies aim at improving the ability of communities and individuals to increase asset ownership, anchor jobs locally, strengthen the municipal tax base, prevent financial resources from 'leaking out' of the area, and ensure local economic stability. The strategic pillars on which the Initiative is built are: (1) leveraging a portion of the multi-billion dollar annual business expenditures of anchor institutions into the surrounding neighborhoods; (2) establishing a robust network of Evergreen Cooperative enterprises based on community wealth building and ownership models designed to service these institutional needs; (3) building on the growing momentum to create environmentally sustainable energy and green collar jobs (and, concurrently, support area anchor institutions in achieving their own environmental goals to shrink their carbon footprints); (4) linking the entire effort to expanding sectors of the economy (e.g., health care, our aging population, local food, and sustainable energy), many of which are recipients of large-scale public investment; and (5) developing the financing and management capacities that can take this effort to scale (that is, to move beyond a few boutique projects or models to have significant municipal impact).\" Evergreen hopes to create as many as ten more cooperatives in the next three to five years, and ultimately create 5,000 cooperative jobs during the next decade. In a city the size of Cleveland, that is a small number, but it represents a model that others can replicate. Success in this initiative would also demonstrate a different, more humane model than that of modern-day capitalism, with its authoritarian top-down structures and vastly unequal levels of compensation and power. Successful local businesses such as these would also stabilize neighborhoods that suffer when jobs in manufacturing and older industries are moved away. Cooperative businesses include Evergreen Laundry, which provides industrial-scale laundry services; Evergreen Energy Solutions, which designs and installs solar panels and provides energy-efficiency services; and Green City Growers Cooperative, which operates a hydroponic food-producing greenhouse covering more than three acres (more than one hectare). Local institutions that contract for services from the cooperatives include Case Western Reserve University, the University Hospitals system and the Cleveland Clinic (a local medical center and research facility). By using local institutions that will not be moving as anchors, the Cleveland model seeks to create worker-owned enterprises that will also stay in the community: \"Rather than a trickle down strategy, it focuses on economic inclusion and building a local economy from the ground up; rather than offering public subsidy to induce corporations to bring what are often low-wage jobs into the city, the Evergreen strategy is catalyzing new businesses that are owned by their employees; rather than concentrate on workforce training for employment opportunities that are largely unavailable to low-skill and low-income workers, the Evergreen Initiative first creates the jobs, and then recruits and trains local residents to take them.\" The Cleveland Foundation, a local funding organization, provided capital, guaranteed a bank loan and conducted talks with executives of the anchor institutions to start the initiative. Each individual business received a loan that was subsidized with federal tax credits, and low-interest funding was also provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Using its seed capital, Evergreen provides long-term financing to start cooperative businesses and to provide them with technical support and training. Similar to Mondragon, on which Evergreen is modeled, employees work a six-month probationary period, then begin to buy into the company through payroll deductions over three years. Evergreen estimates that its worker-owners will build an equity stake of $65,000 after eight years of working at an Evergreen cooperative in a section of Cleveland in which the median annual income is $18,500. When worker-owners retire or leave the company, they relinquish their ownership share and the value of their capital account is returned to them, as their equity stake in the company. Workers also share in the profits generated. Cooperatives as yet are too small to represent anything other than the smallest crack in the edifice of capitalism. But the bricks of today will be used to build the world of tomorrow. These models could spark similar enterprises or cooperatives on different models -- and demonstrate that cooperation can become the standard in a better world. * This discussion of Argentina is based on an excerpt from my forthcoming book It's Not Over: Lessons from the Socialist Experiment . Among the sources used here are lavaca collective, Sin Patrn [Haymarket, 2007]; Peter Elliot, \"Zanon Workers in Argentina Still Waiting for Security,\" posted June 27, 2006, on the Upside Down World web site, upsidedownworld.org; Ginger S. Gentile, \"Argentine Lessons,\" posted March 8, 2004, on the ZNet web site, www.zmag.org; Marie Trigona, \"Argentine Factory Wins Legal Battle: FaSinPat Zanon Belongs to the People,\" posted August 14, 2009, on the Upside Down World web site 9 comments to Cooperation is not only a good idea, it already works in practice \" . . . we should turn over the workings of our entire government to them.\" I'm sure you'd agree that our current models of democracy which are based on 2/3 national political parties funded and supported by business and other vested interests have created a professional political elite that understands its role is to maintain the current status quo whereby there's an ever-widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. The business/finance elite doesn't even need to do the dull law-making stuff themselves since they can govern at one remove through their political henchmen. This is a fascinating account of the developments in Argentina. It's also interesting how the political scene in general in South America has moved on since the days of the fascist military dictatorships and the US-funded 'shock doctrine' that Naomi Klein describes so well. I'll look forward to the publication of your book. GF \"The business/finance elite doesn't even need to do the dull law-making stuff themselves since they can govern at one remove through their political henchmen.\" Indeed, the workings of the system can, and do, go on without the corporate elite getting their fingers dirty in the day-to-day business of government. Although, here in the U.S., there is a bit more blur between the business/finance elite and the professional politicians than in Britain -- ego, I suppose, is as good a reason as any for the billionaire stepping into office direct rather than pulling the strings from behind, although it remains the exception. A critical component of this is the \"winner take all\"/\"first past the post\" system of the U.S. and Britain (and Canada). A parliamentary system gives a bit more room to an extra party, but a single-seat district system with no runoffs insures that there will be only two viable parties. Most people believe that voting for a minor party means leaving the door open to the major party that you hate most getting in, so feel compelled to vote for the \"lesser evil.\" Until there is proportional representation and other participation-encouraging changes, we will be stuck with our current dismal political parties, which serve the powerful so well. Superb post, and very inspiring. I was reminiscing just recently about shopping in our local \"CoOp\" shop and needing to give the shopkeeper your family's CoOp number code every time you bought goods -- which entitled you to a 'dividend' payment at regular intervals -- the idea being that customers who supported the cooperative movement should also benefit from any profits that were generated. A marvelous idea. My partner and I were shopping in a coop ourselves last night. Neither of us are a member of it, but my partner is a member of a local \"community-supported agriculture\" system in which an organic farmer supplies vegetables and other produce and members pay a flat weekly fee. The farmer knows he/she will sell the produce at a stable price and the members receive a large supply of organic, fresh produce for less than they would pay in a supermarket, a particularly healthy alternative for city dwellers. The trick is to seem small, insignificant, like a little Hpipy Dippy food or housing co-op, but constantly subdivide and support laterally . Solidarity and quiet determination. The longer you stay under the oligarchs radar, the less chance they have of finding a way of legislating you out of existence. Possession IS 90% of the law, as your piece illustrates. True cooperation is one of the key aspects of the next ideation of human evolution- \"Human beings can cooperate with one another (and routinely do -- how would a product or service exist if employees did not work together?)\" Not at the corporation I work for -- this one destroys all cooperation in its unending emphasis on productivity measured by the numbers. If you don't make your numbers, you get disciplined. Needless to say, that inhibits cooperation and quality work. Do the job quickly and if there is no time allotted for necessary work, don't do it. If not doing necessary work results in an unhappy customer, so be it. Too bad. Cooperatives \"remain small islands in a vast sea of capitalism. They are merely tolerated by an Argentine establishment loath to appear too openly to challenge continuing community support, and they represent an example that capitalists everywhere wish to stamp out.\" There's that word, again: community. We have no community in this country -- it is everyone for him/herself, which plays right into the hands of the capitalist class. There existed a modicum of community in the unions of the 1930s and 1940s, but that has withered away. It is now not uncommon at all to find union members who belong to the Republican Party, not that the Republicans differ significantly from the Democrats, though many union members harbor that illusion, which is encouraged by the silver-tongued orator currently holding the Presidency. Cooperatives won't get a foothold in this country until we live in community at home and when not at work. As long as The True Believer exists, community won't. The True Believer is the capitalist class's best friend. United we stand, divided we fall could make a difference, but the rise of business unionism has resulted in the abandonment of that idea. Now, the only reason for the existence of unions is to protect the privileges of the union hierarchy. Your corporation sounds typical in atomizing its workforce and forcing employees to compete against one another. I've experienced that, too. But, ultimately, a product or service requires more than one person to create it, so production is ultimately based on workers cooperating with one another, even if under distorted, authoritarian conditions. The worst job I ever had was a two-year stint on the lead Dow Jones financial newswire many years ago. It was an awful place: Everybody was pitted against everybody, you were monitored and subject to discipline if you didn't produce your very high daily quota, the staff were mostly cut-throats scrambling to look good in front of the bosses so they could get a promotion. I've never worked in such a toxic environment, before or since. But the newswire didn't put out hundreds of items a day without all of these people working together, even if it was a top-down, dictatorial system quite typical of a capitalist enterprise. There was no sense of community there. Community is what is missing in the capitalist business enterprise and, as you note, what is needed for cooperative enterprises to exist. Unions today are too focused on managing their decline and are too willing to capitulate. But, let's not write that too simplistically. What community support does a union get when it goes on strike? Generally, very little. The laws are written to prevent unions from giving physical support to another union on strike. Everybody is beaten down because the attacks on working people are relentless and intensifying. The laws are written to make it very difficult to form a union, so union membership has declined precipitously. A never-ending barrage of ideology designed to inculcate individualism breaks down social bonds. When we look at the full picture, there is much more going on than simply bad leadership in unions, although that does exist, most assuredly. You write: \"We have no community in this country -- it is everyone for him/herself, which plays right into the hands of the capitalist class.\" Oh, so true. No wonder, then, that we have almost no unions. \n",

Many of us are simply afraid of sitting in the dentist's chair. Others are not sure what they are entitled to on the NHS or fear they may not get a good deal from a private dentist. To help you we have compiled a complete guide to getting the most from your dentist. Below we explain what dental care you are entitled to on the NHS and, if you decide to go to a private dentist, how to get a fair deal. Click on the links at the bottom of this page to read the rest of our guide which includes a look at the hi-tech gadgets that could make your next trip to the dentist far less painful, details of how to complain if things go wrong and the moves afoot to regulate the private dental industry. WHAT YOU ARE ENTITLED TO ON THE NHS Am I entitled to free dental treatment on the NHS? Everyone in the UK is entitled to NHS dental treatment, but only some people receive the treatment for free. The groups entitled to free treatment are: under 18s, over 18s in full-time education, pregnant women, women who have had a baby in the last 12 months and people on certain benefits. But, although pensioners are entitled to free prescriptions for general medical problems, they are not entitled to free dental treatment. Those entitled to free treatment receive check-ups and all routine treatments - such as metal fillings, extractions, and X-rays for free. Cosmetic dental treatments that are not clinically necessary - such as tooth whitening - are not free. The rest of the population is also entitled to visit an NHS dentist, but will have to pay for check-ups and dental work. These prices are set each April and are the same across the country. An NHS check-up currently costs 5.32, a small filling is 5.64 and an extraction is 9.52. For a full list of prices contact the British Dental Health Foundation's helpline on 0870 333118. What if I am on a low income and am not entitled to free NHS dental treatment? Even if you do not fall into one of the main categories that is entitled to free dental treatment you may still be able to get some help paying for your dental work. Students, people on low incomes and some pensioners may receive support after filling in an HC1 form - a type of means test. These forms are available from post offices and dentists. Each case is assessed on its individual merits. How can I find my nearest NHS dentist? Your area health authority will have a list of all the NHS dentists in your area. You can find the number for your area health authority in the council services section at the front of your Yellow Pages. You should be aware, however, that most NHS dentists have a waiting list. You may have to wait anything from a few weeks to several months for a place. What if it is an emergency? If you have a dental emergency and all your local NHS dentists have long waiting lists contact your area health authority. They will be able to arrange for you to attend an NHS walk in centre or put you in touch with an emergency dentist. However, after your emergency treatment you will have to join a waiting list for another NHS dentist. Once I have joined an NHS dentist will I be registered for life? No. It's important to know that your name will be removed from an NHS dentist's register if you do not attend an appointment for 15 months. Ideally you should try to visit the dentist at least once a year. Is NHS treatment guaranteed? All NHS treatment is guaranteed for one year. What if I have a complaint about my NHS dentist? If you are unhappy with your dental treatment the British Dental Health Foundation advises you approach your dentist in person or in writing in the first instance. If you still can not resolve the problem you should then write a formal letter of complaint to your dentist. Once this process has started you must receive a letter acknowledging receipt of your complaint within two days and a full response within ten days. If you are still unhappy you should contact your local area health authority and if you are still unhappy contact the General Dental Council on 0207 887 3800. \n",
            "NA NE\t3279058\tThe Minnesota DNR says a water storage area between Comstock and Horace that's part of the proposed Red River Diversion project could be damaging if it fails. The Minnesota DNR is calling it highly hazardous, saying there could be some severe consequences if parts of the proposed Red River Diversion fails. An environmental impact statement in the works says a water storage area failure could lead to a lot more than just flooding. The Minnesota DNR says a water storage area between Comstock and Horace that's part of the proposed Red River Diversion project could be damaging if it fails. Jason Boyle - State Dam Safety Engineer: \"Potential for loss of life, or damage to property or health, or economic loss to the public.\" The DNR's talking about a stretch between the two towns marked for a 15 foot tall structure that could keep back 200 thousand acre-feet of water. The DNR says they're not judging the structure itself -- just the impacts of possible failure or mis-operation. Jason Boyle: \"We don't assume how it would fail; we just assume the worst possible scenario.\" The Richland-Wilkin Joint Powers Authority says if the dam did fail -- expansive clay could be to blame. Nathan Berseth: \"People need to know it's more than just a diversion. They continue to talk about the diversion but there is a dam there as well. I, for one, wouldn't want to be sitting on the other side of that dam.\" The Flood Diversion Board says so far the design is not even complete and reducing downstream impacts is still a top priority. Designs for that piece of the proposed project should be finished up between September of this year, and early next year. \n",
            "IN CM RA\t0324808\tWave-Particle Duality Publicized early in the debate about whether light was composed of particles or waves, a wave-particle dual nature soon was found to be characteristic of electrons as well. The evidence for the description of light as waves was well established at the turn of the century when the photoelectric effect introduced firm evidence of a particle nature as well. On the other hand, the particle properties of electrons was well documented when the DeBroglie hypothesis and the subsequent experiments by Davisson and Germer established the wave nature of the electron. Photoelectric Effect Analysis of data from the photoelectric experiment showed that the energy of the ejected electrons was proportional to the frequency of the illuminating light. This showed that whatever was knocking the electrons out had an energy proportional to light frequency. The remarkable fact that the ejection energy was independent of the total energy of illumination showed that the interaction must be like that of a particle which gave all of its energy to the electron! This fit in well with Planck's hypothesis that light in the blackbody radiation experiment could exist only in discrete bundles with energy Wave-Particle Duality: Light By the turn of the 20th century, most physicists were convinced by phenomena lke the above that light could be fully described by a wave, with no necessity for invoking a particle nature. But the story was not over. \n",

The interview with Anthony Puttee will, I think, help me over the last hurdle of design before getting my book \"On the Road to Auroville\" out there! Hope London is working out for you -- my sister went the other way, and it was while visiting her in Melbourne that I began to write my first book. I am also interested in religious thrillers -- and hope to base my next book in medieval Andalusia which I think is my spiritual home! Jon x My book, The Destiny Project, has sold over 1500 e-books on Kindle in the last fifteen days (August 27 thru today). Do you have any suggestions on how I can significantly increase these sales? Thank You -- James Wharton One quick question....(and btw, I LOVE the program AND the people! Keith rules!)....when you do your second draft in Scrivener, do you make a new project, make a new folder, use the revision mode, or some other method? I'm writing narrative non-fiction (seems to be a memoir; yes, my life is that entertaining!) and have 221 folders/documents in the Draft alone. I'm feeling paranoid about editing b/c I went back to Word. What was I thinking!?! Hi Christine, on Scrivener, I export Drafts pretty much every day in Word format and store them in my Gmail so I have multiple backups of work in progress -- with the date appended so I can keep track. Then I just use the same Scrivener project for the full drafts all the way to publishing. I am making changes to an already published book right now for submission and I created a copy of the project and made the changes in the new one as that is essentially like a brand new book. So there are no rules, but when in doubt, backup and export i, i am a middle school teacher looking for materials to teach students an effective yet easy way to write a short story when i chanced upon your site. it's a wonderful site and helped me much.thank you. Kudos! I think this is one of my favorite posts of yours. I contacted you a year or two ago, wanting you on my podcast, Brain Burps About Books but something happened that put the kibosh on that. You and I do similar things and I STILL want you on my show. Please come! My peeps would love to hear you talk about your journey, your struggles, your advice, and your successes. Whether or not you do, I'm thrilled for your success, and very happy to read about your commitment to a real life coffee or lunch once a week -- I need to do that too! I could work ALL day alone in my studio, loving it, but you are right. I need to get out! Hello Joanna, I stumbled upon your site when googling \"How to books\". The article about \"How to sell 1 million E-books\" immediately caught my attention. Your desire to help others like myself stands out and separates you from other sites and authors I have seen. The tools you have and the \"Inspiration\" I felt in glancing over them, gives me a much needed boost to continue on with my heartfelt desire as well...I look forward to investing more time and energy to get the word out on my first book. I have searched and searched and to my surprise have found some articles but no other books on \"How to create Camaraderie\". I developed a simple website for fun but one day hope to take my work to the next level such as yourself and beyond. One small step for a simple man, One giant leap for all the rest. Hi Joanna Your website is brilliant. Thanks for all the information you provide. I am going to self publish shortly and upload to create space. Its my first time to do this. Please can you tell me where to obtain the few lines at the front that i see in most books about the copywright act 1988 ? Is this standard blurb about no one copying ones book according to this act, or do have to get a lawyer to write this for me ?? Thanks kind regards Marina Hi Joanna, I have just come across your site and I am loving it! Thank you for sharing your writing journey. It must be challenging to fit in your work, writing and keeping a well populated blog going. I seem to lack the ability to stick with an idea for too long -- I have many 10,000 -- 30,000 word stories floating around in my computer as well as about 100 ideas never expanded upon! When you have fought the battle to get to 30,000 words it is hard to know whether you should keep working on it, editing and reshaping, or whether it was an \"apprenticeship\" and now you should move on. I am looking forward to reading through your notes. Hi Melissa -- if your 10-30k word stories are ready to go, you should consider putting them on Amazon as shorts. There are a lot of novellas selling well right now, for this length. With ebooks, there is no perfect length and in fact, more books on Amazon means better sales -- so maybe think about getting those novellas edited and then look into publishing them. Just a thought I'm going to be writing more novellas as well so it is a great place to be! Thanks, Joanna Thanks for all the useful information on your website. It is so good having such a resource. I have been looking at various ebook publishing sites and was wondering which ones you recommend or stay clear of. I plan to use Kindle as a given and the ibook, but what do you think of Barnes & Noble, Sony & Kobo? I decided against using smashwords and lulu as middlemen. Your advice would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks Hi Jay, I use KDP for Amazon, Kobo Writing Life -- so both of those direct. If you are in the US, you can use Nook PubIt -- but you can also use BookBaby.com to distribute to all those sites -- or just some of them. I use BookBaby for Nook, iBookstore, Sony and all the other smaller sites. I hope that helps. Thanks, Joanna I am well impressed with your site and your approach to the whole field of epublishing. I am just working through Author2.0 as well as checking out the various articles etc on this site. This is an excellent resource -- and it appears that your success is well deserved. Well done and good for you. Your novels aren't my usual cup of tea but I'll have a peruse of those too -- I'll let you know if I do buy either although I wonder whether waiting for the rewrite would be wiser... Thanks Will -- I'm glad you're enjoying the site. I will be relaunching the first 2 books when I launch Exodus, the 3rd in the series, (hopefully) in December So you're welcome to wait! I also have some novellas planned ... I'm about to self publish my first book on create space where they will make it available to amazon e.t.c for sale. If possible, do you know which data bases i would need to register the book with? I think I read somewhere that I would need to send a copy to the British Library. Do I need to send it to any other places ? I've read about LCCN in america -- the library catalogue. Do we have an equivalent catalogue in the UK ??? Thanks so much Marina First off I want to thank you for the incredibly helpful and informative posts you have here on this blog. I myself am a writer and with my self-publication day is fast approaching I find your website to be invaluable. In fact, it was your website that convinced me to start a blog so I might promote my work once it is on the market. However, there is one point that I need help with in regards to my fledgling blog. I have only created it and I'm still coming up with posts for it but almost no one is looking. Any tips for getting my blog noticed? Hi RA, This is definitely totally normal! Back in 2008 when I started this site, I had almost zero traffic for the first 3 months and nothing significant for at least a year. Some tips are: * make sure you're using an SEO plugin like All in One SEO Pack on a self-hosted WP blog * understand some of the 'rules' around copywriting and headlines that make people want to read -- check out Copyblogger.com for the best free tutorials on this * write articles people want to read * get off your blog and onto similar ones e.g. guest post, or do interviews etc so people are led back to your site That's some basic tips but getting traffic is certainly everyone's challenge! The other question is -- why do you want that traffic? what are the goals of your blog and make sure you're heading for those goals. I hope that helps. Thanks, Joanna You have proved to us all that social media can be a fun, sometimes frustrating, but creative way to bring your book to life. My book is nearly complete but little did I realise the depth of resources available via social media and I am embarking on a steep but fun learning curve. For years I ignored facebook, but have recently been watching your videos and slowly but surely I am seeing the potential as my book page takes shape. I must say you are fast becoming and unseen mentor.I thank God for you having a goal,going after it and at the same time helping people out especially author,writers and indie publishers. On a random hungry search for information on book marketing, I came across thecreativepenn.com and since then,I can't stop helping myself crawling this site for informations,knowledge and tips for been a successful writer. And my favorite here is your podcasts,I can't just help downloading all and listening to them,they are all eye opener for me on the road to the journey of self publishing. Thanks so much for giving out such loads of free resources for all,not many people have such an heart of going the extra length to help others out I already eagerly await fresh posts and also can't wait to feed on all you have here,just hope I won't use all your bandwidth up for doing this,lol You have been a source of inspiration for me and I look up to the day that I will have an interview with you,maybe a podcast too and I will share my success stories with you,all thanks to your the coaching I got crawling your site everyday. Joanna, You are a wealth of information, and wonderful for sharing. Thank you! I wrote a 300 page manuscript about my near death experience as a medium. I am now a channeler (and medium) and intend to self publish the book as an ebook. I am establishing my author platform, setting up my website in WP, plugging in the SEO options. Being ill has led me to leaving my humanitarian position, so sadly I am on a shoestring budget. I have asked all those who can handle editing I know, to help with editing in exchange for a small stipend or something they need, and it's a no go. I cannot afford professional editing services without a writer's grant, but I know my book has to be as pristine as possible to be taken seriously. What do you suggest? Thanks so much for your time! Bright blessings, Sandra Hi Sandra, for editing, I would suggest bartering your services with another writer in the same genre e.g. reviewing each others work. The more you can do this, the more you will learn. You can find people at critique groups, online if you can't get to them locally. All the best! I wanted to let you know that I have heard http://www.scribophile.com is an excellent online critique group. I will be using it myself most likely at some point. You have to critique other writings to gain points, and then you spend those points to post your own writing. It's a good way to learn from others, plus an excellent source for editing. You can get line edits too, so that would be perfect for you I think. I'm sorry to hear about your bad patch, I truly hope things start looking up for you. Thank you Joanna and Nicholas for your insight! I appreciate your compassion and help. I will look into your ideas- my only issue is I am still recovering and cannot commit to editing another writer's work. Still I thank you both for taking time to answer me so quickly. Bright blessings! Sandra \n"

            "Talk To Your Parents Sometimes, people just don't feel well. But if you don't feel well more than sometimes, it may be helpful to talk to someone about it. Why might it be helpful to talk to a family member? A lot of people just don't want to talk about difficult experiences. Everyone has their own reason to keep quiet. Some people may have a lot of inside fears: they don't want to admit that there is something wrong, they blame themselves, they don't think anyone else will understand. Other people may have a lot of outside fears: they don't want other people to find out, they don't want to lose friends, they don't want to disappoint anyone, they don't want other people to take care of them. The problem is that it can be really tough to deal with difficult feeling on your own. But it's also hard to find support if you don't ask for support. Often, the quickest and most direct way to find support is to ask for it. Part of being strong and in control is knowing when to ask for help. Sometimes, just having someone to talk to can really help people feel better. There is another reason for talking with a family member. If you're dealing with the health care system, like going to doctor's appointments, you may need an adult's help. What do we mean by \"family member?\" A family member is anyone in your support circle that you feel you can rely on. It could be a parent or step-parent, an aunt or an uncle, an older sister or brother, or a grandparent. It could also be someone from your community, like a teacher or other school staff member, a friend's parents, or a family friend. Talking to a family member Talking to a family member is a huge step. No matter what happens, you should feel proud that you brought your concerns into the open. It takes a lot of courage! One way to tackle the first conversation is to prepare ahead of time. If you know what you want and know how you want to say it, it can be easier to bring up with other people. Below, you'll see different points to think about. Sometime, family members don't react to these tough conversations in helpful ways. Remember, you are not responsible for their reaction. Their reaction reflects them, not you. You can't control how other people react, but you can control how you react. Before the conversation Think about what you want to say and how you want to say it. Sometime people even write notes to help organize their thoughts. Think about what you want to come out of the conversation. Do you need a family member to help you see a doctor or other health professional? Do you want to try new strategies at home? Do you just want to talk? Think about the best time and place to bring up the conversation. If you try to talk to a family member when they're busy, tired or stressed out, they may not be able to listen as well as they'd like. You can even ask when they're available to talk about something important and ask them to set aside the time for you. During the conversation Don't be afraid to take control. It's hard to talk about difficult feelings or experiences. Some people find that it's easier to say what they feel if they can just get it out without interruptions. Try, \"It's hard for me to talk about this. It would really help if you just listen until I'm finished. Then we can talk about it together.\" Try to be honest and direct. A family member needs to understand what the problem is and what you want them to do about it. Try to be clear about why you're having the conversation and what you want to happen next. Try to stay on topic. This isn't the time to bring up old fights or disagreements. If a family member  isn't staying on topic, you can always remind them why you're talking. Try, \"I know you're upset about (something that's happened), but right now I need to talk to you about the way I've been feeling.\" Try to keep your cool. Yelling, getting angry or getting defensive can really derail a conversation. If you feel very angry or upset, it may be more helpful to take a break. Prepare back-up. Some people don't have all the information about mental health. If they don't get the problem, they may not know what to do. Suggest resources that they can check out, like the organizations [in the resource section]. You can always continue the conversation after they've checked out information for themselves. End an unhelpful conversation. Sometimes, a family member won't know what to do or say. They might react poorly or just not say anything that all. This can be frustrating, especially when you're trying to reach out for help! If you're having a hard time making the conversation work, it may be helpful to end it for a while. This will give everyone a chance to think about the issues. Try, \"I don't think this is working right now and I'm feeling really frustrated. Can we take a break and pick up the conversation in two days?\" After the conversation Awesome -- you've made it through the really tough part! If you conversation went well, you can start planning your next steps. If you don't think your conversation ended well, try not to feel discouraged. These conversations are tough for everyone. Some people don't react well when they have to hear something difficult or emotional. If you think that your family member just need some time and information, think of how you might work together to learn more and work together. For example, you could suggest resources you like and schedule another conversation later in the week. If you just don't think this is going work, it may be time to ask for outside help. Think about the options below and decide what feel most comfortable. What if I just can't talk to my parents? Sometimes, you just can't talk to people in your family. This can be really hard to handle, but it's important to keep trying until you find someone that can help. Here are a few suggestions: Your school counsellor A teacher you trust Another family member, like an older brother or sister or an aunt or uncle \n",
            "The Top TEN 'Whiniest Sets of Fans' in English Football The art of moaning is almost intrinsically built within us as football fans. As much as we love a 30-yard-screamer or a derby day thumping, we also love to indulge in a spot of match-day whining. As good as a match-day is, it just wouldn't be the same without finding something to kick-off about. No matter how well your team have performed, be it the extortionate Yorkie bar that has forced you to break into a fiver, to your teams' right-back's insistence on wearing gloves in August, we simply love to whine. But for some fans, a bit of harmless complaining resembles so much more than a simple bit of fun- it is a way of life. Indeed, for this bunch, the whining is incessant, the fickleness is in abundance and their unworldly levels of expectation simply will never be satisfied. In no particular order, here is an over the top, over exaggerative, completely unbalanced yet painfully true take on ten of the whiniest fans in English football. \n",
            "Ferry consultation needs deeper questions, says advocate A transportation advocacy group is circulating a list of 100 questions aimed at broadening the British Columbia government's consultation on coastal ferry services. \"Every aspect of the ferry system has to be looked at and the data has to be complete,\" said Gregg Dow, the president of the BC Coastal Transportation Society. \"We just demonstrated how complicated it is. It's a disservice of the provincial government not to bring that into the decision making process.\" The provincial government is at the start of a $700,000 consultation process Transportation Minister Mary Polak launched in late October aimed at cutting $26 million from BC Ferries' budget. Through a request for proposals process to run the consultation, the transportation ministry hired Kirk & Co. Consulting Ltd. in August. Elections BC records show Kirk & Co. has been a regular donor to the BC Liberal Party. The company has given nearly $12,000 to the governing party since 2005, and principal Judy Kirk has also made personal donations to the Liberals. Materials circulated as part of the consultation process look at the cost of each route, its capacity and how much it is used. There are many other factors that come into play, including regulations around things like crewing levels, transportation of dangerous goods and weight allowances, said Dow. \"What impacts will it have on the economies of these communities? Has the governemnt even looked at that?\" Many of the questions focus on how BC Ferries and the government calculated the capacity that they say is under used. The full list is available on the BCCTS website . Here are 12 of them: Has the Government/BC Ferries undertaken an evaluation of what constitutes 'Core Ferry Service'? It appears the Government is prepared to adjust Core Ferry Services downward in response to BC Ferries' escalating cost overruns. At what point does the Government determine Core Ferry Services will have bottomed out? Is the Government aware if any of the costs of the new BC Ferries Head Office has been allocated out to the fleet? Is the Government aware if any of the costs of the BC Ferries Vacation Centre have allocated out to the fleet? How have the two boards of directors expenses been allocated to the fleet, since 2003? When BC Ferries replaces vessels on Route 1, exchanging a Spirit Class Vessel with a Super C, they've reduced the capacity for those sailings. Did the Province review and account for the differences in capacity between vessels? Do BC Ferries' policies around on time performance -- specifically in how it determines how the vessels are to be loaded, cut-off times, and the handling of traffic in the terminals -- ultimately defeat its ability to meet maximum capacity utilization targets? Has the Government considered reductions to Management Bonus Plans to reduce drain on the fare and subsidy revenue at BCFS and thus protect farepayers and taxpayers interests? How does BC Ferries' Reservations policy affect capacity? Has the Government/BC Ferries determined if it is a deterrent to travel for some potential passengers? Has the Government evaluated what impact the loss of Tourism BC for three years had on ridership at BC Ferries? A large percentage of the loss posted to each route comprises the cost of central management, the cost of ship refits and terminal upgrades, and the cost of financing and amortization of BCF's $1.4 billion dollar debt. In what way will deep cuts to service reduce these expenses? In 2002, the Government promised improved service and predictable fares. The current consultation process the Government is undertaking demonstrates the business model isn't working. At what point does the government go back to the legislation and fix it?

Illahie If ferries is actually a private corporation If ferries is actually a private corporation, who gives a hoot whether they made a bad deal with government, and lose money as a result? If Exon or some other public company were to lose money would our provincial government try to help out. If ferries is actually government, then the operation should be treated like government. If the costs of maintaining our highways were to go up, the government would fund the increased costs of maintaining our roads. If the provincial government wants to get ferries back in the black, all they have to do is take back the 1.3 billion or so in debt that was wracked up David Hahn during his tenure. The interest payments on the Hahn debt is causing ferries to lose money. Dave50 Gulf island ferries BC Ferries does not want to touch the huge hog trough pay raises and bonuses to their executives.Total cost of 'management' should be 10% of operations ... I'll bet its nearly half the cost of personnel and not needed. When the liberal government hands you money and you have a monopoly you should balance the books every time.The BC liberal government is directly 100% responsible for the bad shape of BC ferries.The BC liberals paid ex BC ferries CEO David Hahn more than the prime minster and all, the admiral in the navy combined.Why would someone choose to move to the gulf island , then whine and cry about the ferry service.If you choose to live on the gulf island then get out your wallet, or buy a boat and commute back and forth.Half the trips are running a less than 1/4 capacity.Some living in a million dollar gulf island waterfront house trying to commute daily back and forth should not be totally subsidized by the taxpayer.Blame the BC liberal,Bc ferries paid David Hahn more than a 5 star adimral in the USA navy for running a 36 ship fleet which could be run out of a one room office.David hahn 48,000 a month pension benifit is what the Bc fiberl pay 70 people at 700.00 a month. But the actual blame for this must be laid squarely at the feet of those in Victoriathe BC Fiberals whom we elected to be the guardians of the public trust. If our politicians are willing to pay Hahn more than the Prime Minister and the Premier of BC combined, they're the ones who are to blame for this absolute travesty Ex Bc ferries liberal appointee David Hahn make more in a month pension benefits, than a full time employee working 40 ours or more a week makes in a year, and the every single honest taxpayer in BC has to pay . virimpig BCFerries The total ineptitude of the BCFerries management is a joke! And all this kerfluffle about cutting costs is a prelude to unloading the albatross back to the Dept. of Highways or Transportartion (or whatever Christy's women's auxiliary running this province until next spring calls it) so that it can be handled efficiently without the atronomical levels of management and salaries at FleetHouse!

            "I'v been recording and mixing music for about 4 years now. In this time I'v probably done around 100 tracks. My clients are always happy and they do come back but I am not even close to being happy. I really feel like I should be better than I am and feel like I'm just stuck with fairly amateur sounding records. I'm almost at the point where its making me feel depressed and this stress and worry just makes things even harder. I know it sounds a bit extreme but you know when you want something so bad that you just cant have it... thats the feeling! I'v been mixing an EP by a band for about 3 months now and its getting to the point where they're getting a bit peaved off at me. Its a really great record which seems to be heightening the pressure (i dont wanna fluff it up!). The problem is whatever I do I cant settle on anything and i just keep going round in circles trying different stuff, starting again etc etc. I just wonder... will I ever finish it? This is the first time I'v ever felt incapable of mixing something. So I'm just looking for a bit of advice really. I'm sure many people have hit this brick wall. What do you do when you just cant seem to mix something? Hi, You have mixed it...you just didn't know when to stop and move on! Are the band peaved because it sounds bad or at you because you are taking so long? I suggest finishing it...even though you will not be satisfied. Time to let go and learn methinks! Dave More peaved that Im taking so long to finish it.. theyre nice guys so they havent officially said theyre annoyed, but I can sooooo tell! 2 of the tracks I thought were finished, I sent them over and they were not over the moon about them, said they could be improved. Im struggling to improve them! 1. spend 1 day (6 to 10 hours) per mix. Then ask the band for changes. Dont fu.ck about. You're done 2. What band do they sound like? Mix it like that. 3. mix time is NOT creative time ( no matter what the many jocks who do it all tell you; I mix for a living, a proper living - sure there is a bit of creativity but you're not trying to make the song be something else - if you're trying to get John Bonham drums but the drummer plays like a punk then you're wasting your time. Secondly - if you want John Bonhma drums you have to record John Bonham drums. If you have recorded tight sounding drums then that is what you go for ). You RECORD a record - mixing is about fulfilling what you promised at recording.... in other words mix what's there. And when you get feedback from the band that it 'isn't right', don't settle for that and keep going round in circles. Get them to commit and say WHY they don't think it is right, and WHAT they think is wrong. They need to give you a clear idea of where to focus, it's their record after all. This has happened to me when I don't have a clear idea from the outset how the finished product is supposed to sound. Either the band gives you that, or you bring that vision to them. If neither of you has it then any technically competent mix is pretty much as good as any other. So you might as well just stop and hand it back to the band. Presumably they are not paying you for all this soul searching? I have learned to close down projects like this fairly quickly. Who are you trying to please here? If the band are happy with your last mix, that's the mix. If they have specific requirements that you are struggling to fulfill then what are the barriers, and are we really talking about performance and arrangement issues? You can't own the whole problem, the band has responsibilities too While I like to have some time on my own when I'm starting a mix so that I can do all the tidying up and getting basic sounds without someone breathing down my neck, when it gets towards the end of the process I find it helpful to have someone from the band there with me. Maybe not the whole band as things can get very confusing with too many opinions but it helps to have ideas from someone else. I'd also agree that if a mix is taking more than a few hours there's probably something more fundamental wrong with it. Hey Chewy, I have been in similar positions to yourself, but maybe because i am a bit of a t@&% , I have no problem explaining to bands/artists, A) my limitations, given the equipment/environment I have and the price I charge and B) their expectations given their skills and the price they are paying. The bottom line is, you have done your best, if they want it better, either they should pay you more or you give them the files so that someone else can mix ....OR they pay more at the outset for a higher end studio....DO NOT BEAT YOURSELF UP TOO MUCH!.....only a little! Dave In other words, four years isn't a long time to be learning your chops. You learn on every mix for decades. Or you should. But three months to mix a few tracks (assuming you're working solid) is a very long time. You need to be clear about when you're solving problems/refining a mix, and when you're learning stuff anew. Fine to take a bit of time to do the former. The latter are lessons to be applied to future projects. If you are too insistent on perfection that's by its nature out of reach, you'll never get to the stage where you can mix *anything* to your satisfaction. Wise words above about finishing a mix relatively quickly and then getting specific comments from the band. I'd add to that to talk about expectations, stylistic and sonic influences before the recording session. Get hold of some reference tracks you can use while mixing - not just tunes they like, but how this bit builds to the chorus; how that vocal space/treatment is amazing; how the drums work etc. You have a rough target then and will know what's realistic or be able to suggest alternative directions. The only caveat I'd add is that Narco's advice doesn't relate to all styles of music, nor all interpretations of the title 'mix engineer'. For instance, the line between mixing, programming and remixing is a very blurry one. Whatever it is you're doing, though, and however you interpret the term, be clear about what the band expects of you and what you expect to be doing; and bill/take credit accordingly. Mismatch of those expectations is a huge disappointment for everyone concerned. If you've really hit a block on this particular one, and need to get through it, here's what I recommend... (1) Get a bit of distance from it. Leave it a few days at least. Clear your head - go do something other than mixing. (2) Come back and just listen through once or twice with fresh ears. Don't do anything to it. (3) Next day, listen through with a pen and paper and make a snag list of things to fix/change. Don't get too hung up on technical problems, though do note them. Think about the macro side of things as well as the tiny details -- can you hear the lyrics; is the bass even and sufficiently tight; are the transitions working; does the track build and strip down in the right way. Etc. (4) Then wait another day and come back to work through the list. Half the notes you'll read and thing \"nah, doesn't need it, what was I thinking\"; others will help you focus and move on. (5) When you've made it through that, review it one more time in a similar way on a compressed timescale. And call that a day. (6) Learn from the experience and move on to your next project -- which will be a bit better; as will the next one after that. Etc. They won't be if you go down this road with every mix! I think my advice would be to remember that fundamentally, mixing a band is about balancing the relative levels of the tracks, not about processing them or adding effects. Try stripping back all your plug-ins and getting a mix together using the faders alone, at least as a first step. The only caveat I'd add is that Narco's advice doesn't relate to all styles of music, nor all interpretations of the title 'mix engineer'. For instance, the line between mixing, programming and remixing is a very blurry one. It's not a blurry one when you're hired as a mixer. The blurring comes from having to do several roles - in which cases the blurring is in the role of the person and not in what the person is doing! If you are \"programming\" during a mix then you are not mixing. You are programming, re-arranging, producing etc. Of course, when you are doing several roles it most certainly is easy to get bogged down in transitioning. The trick is to understand exactly where you are in the process - I have the luxury of never mixing my own production work and only mixing work from other recordists/producers!! The only caveat I'd add is that Narco's advice doesn't relate to all styles of music, nor all interpretations of the title 'mix engineer'. For instance, the line between mixing, programming and remixing is a very blurry one. It's not a blurry one when you're hired as a mixer. The blurring comes from having to do several roles - in which cases the blurring is in the role of the person and not in what the person is doing!! If you are \"programming\" during a mix then you are not mixing. You are programming, re-arranging, producing. Once that is DONE then you are mixing!! Hmmm... so its just summing then is it? No effects, no delay lines? No mutes? No tonal changes to anything? I think that it *is* a blurry line when there is no official job description and half the world has a different interpretation of what a mix engineer should do, or be allowed to do to their material. Point being, whatever your role, and whatever you perceive as your role, and whatever you call yourself... it's a good plan to make sure that you and the client have a common understanding of what your role is. ie make sure the client and the contractor have an agreed scope of project and standard of work. Same as in any other walk of life. If a band holds a false assumption/expectation, it's your job to set them straight before you start working. Quote Sam Inglis: mix together using the faders alone, at least as a first step. Good idea. Kinda depends where you are on this mix at the moment, though. And in light of what Narco has said about definition of roles, do make sure that the arrangement, editing etc has been done to your satisfaction before trying to mix. Maybe that's your job too, maybe it isn't. But it will make the basic side of the mix job much easier. Hmmm... so its just summing then is it? No effects, no delay lines? No mutes? No tonal changes to anything? No - that's clearly daft!!! Of course it involves those changes. Quote Matt Houghton: I think that it *is* a blurry line when there is no official job description and half the world has a different interpretation of what a mix engineer should do, or be allowed to do to their material. It's not up for interpretation despite being inter petted!! hahah. A mixers role is to mix the music as per the producers wishes. The problem comes if you are recordist, producer and mixer. Thats when people start to blur roles and that is when issue happen. If you can keep the roles distinct, even if doing them all yourself, then it helps a lot. Quote Matt Houghton: Point being, whatever your role, and whatever you perceive as your role, and whatever you call yourself... it's a good plan to make sure that you and the client have a common understanding of what your role is. ie make sure the client and the contractor have an agreed scope of project and standard of work. Same as in any other walk of life. If a band holds a false assumption/expectation, it's your job to set them straight before you start working. Absolutely right!! But if a band thinks a mixers role is to sort out arrangements then they are in for a surprise! One does do that when requested and of course, sometimes you get into discussions about things not working. Those are production works and they are dealt with on a project by project basis. When you're mixing - you're mixing. The blurring of roles is in people doing multiple jobs.... My advice is separate the roles. DON'T blur the roles, it makes your output far more complicated and you end up chasing your tale. Quote jaminem: I'd spend 400 upgrading my mains cables if I were you. Its the only way to get a decent sounding record. sorry, wrong thread. Wrong thread indeed... Seriously, chew_rocket have you tried to mix something in a studio different than your own? Maybe your problem lies with the acoustics of your control room. Bad acoustics can make mixing very frustrating. It would help if you were more specific about the things that frustrate you: lack of clarity? harshness? lack of loudness? Forget room acoustics for a minute... Can the band play? I mean really play? There's a difference between what some would consider good and what is actually good in a studio recording scenario. Your drummer has to be getting the sounds from his kit to begin with, is he? Is he hitting consistently? You could be running round in circles trying to get the best snare sound from a close mic in one section of a song only to find another section or other hits are completely different, how do you deal with that? Samples? Is he hitting consistently enough to trigger reliable samples? And that's just the drummer! I'm forever putting out mixes I'm not 100% happy with and 99% if the ine the fact is, it's the player's fault and their playng has restricted what I can do. Sad but true. Not everyone can be that good. Some great advice here. Like I said, its never happened before and I think I'm just feeling the pressure to better recordings they have done in the past (they asked if i could better them before they came, I said and thought I could!). Although I'v spent hours and hours on these mixes. Im thinking I'll just start again. Forgot what I'v done and give it another shot! Good luck, but unless you know specifically what it is that you want to be different, and in what way, is it not possible that you will end up in the same place in a few days time? Or if you do know that and just can't get it out of the recordings you are working with you might have to start looking at other options (which I know you must be considering), like - recording some parts again - bringing in someone else for a second opinion/a bit of collaboration - taking the mix to a different environment to mix in - sometimes gives a different perspective I am not an industry professional. But when I read this thread, I thought, customer expectation and requirements -- have they truly been defined and understood. Suggest going through the song section by section with band individuals or in groups and making notes on what they want. Effectively, writing down their requirements. Also worth touching on Roles and Responsibilities; i.e. production, mixing etc..... and what they actually mean and what your scope is. Then agree on any conflicts they have for each section. Summarise this and send to them -- get it signed off if needs be. You then have an agreed brief to work with. Sounds a bit formal, but will help you to get to end of job and close this one off against an agreed spec. i, been reading the thread and thought i'd offer my experience with this situation. i've been polishing a turd for a friend recently (read this months sounding off? - exactly that situation). and have left the tracks for about 3 or 4 weeks, come back to them and it all become clear what needed to be done, mostly removing plug ins that wernt needed and automation issues, and it just fell into place. i'd recommend what people have said above and take a break from it and then listen again and make some notes. Good luck with it though it can be tough with pressure from the band.. anyway back to the day job for me this is something i can relate to....i am my own worst critic.....ive been doing this for about 12 years now and still i get things that im not happy with....after about 5 years of recording bands for a living i noticed something....some people cant really play but talk like they can..it started with a drummer that came in one weekend ....he had the best drum kit i have ever seen..all the best extra bits ...spoke at length about all the recording sessions he had done..so i thought \"this is gonna be a easy day\"..that was until he sat behind the kit...it sounded awful...and i got really frustrated because here was a guy with good set of drums ,witha lot of experiance and i was making him sound like crap...so i spent ages helping him tune the drums but everytime i went into the control room to see if i was making any head-way, it still sounded like crap ...at this point the rest of the band turned up .so i said \"how about you go get a coffee or something i will spend a wee bit of time tuning this kit up\"......so i hit record and off i went to tune the kit...now im not saying im a good drummer but when i sat behind this kit i thought it sounded ace so off i went to the control room to see...to my amazment the kit sounded fine..so when he came back i asked him to play some grooves ...to my amazment he was hitting the drums at the edges and was barely touching the kick pedal and hitting the cymbals so hard they didnt make any noise.truth was he was a rich kid that never set foot in a studio or even played a gig. still got a recording done .. was i happy with the mixes ??? nope.....the band thought the mixes and the session was ace 3 months.....wow thats a long time......to be honest if icant get a mix right in a hour i feel something else is wrong the lesson i learned from that weekend..\"not every band is led zepplin\" its about learning how i can change gear to accomadate the client Happy to report that I had a VERY productive session today. Stopped getting so hung up on little things and just ploughed through a tune. Ended up with FAR less processing than prior mixes and am very happy with it. I actually had a friend who is a musician (but in no way a producer/engineer) come over as a second pair of ears. It really helped me and I think I'm all set to blitz through the rest now. \n",
            "The 25-year-old did have chances at Anfield. But he lacked the composure of his team-mates and already some are starting to question whether the 9.6million signing from Montpellier can have the impact Wenger demands. The Gunners chief believes it is far too early to make negative judgements. And Wenger claimed his battle with Martin Skrtel will prove to be a valuable part of an important learning process. \"I am confident about him,\" said Wenger. \"Giroud is in an adaptation period. He has shown he is ready for a fight and I am sure he will adapt to the intensity of an English striker. \"Against Skrtel he discovered what the Premier League is all about.\" Here's a reminder of what Giroud can achieve in front of goal... Wenger is on much safer ground considering the merits of Abou Diaby. The 26-year-old's qualities have never been questioned. Far more of an issue are the numerous injury problems he has encountered. Diaby was restricted to just four Premier League appearances last term, all as a substitute. However, in the wake of Alex Song's departure, Diaby is more important than ever to the Arsenal cause. Alou Diaby: the new Vieira? Andrew Powell His superb performance at Liverpool was reminiscent of Patrick Vieira in his pomp. Now Wenger just needs the France midfielder to stay healthy. \"If he is fit and healthy, Diaby has the talent,\" said Wenger. \"You can see he is massive for us because he has everything you would want in a midfielder. \"I stood behind him because I know he is not only a fantastic player but a fantastic guy as well. \"He hasn't played for a year but now he looks in good shape. \"There is more to come but let's touch wood and hope it goes well in the next two or three weeks because he is going away with the national team. \n",
            "Elizabethan Science and Technology Elizabethan Period and Elizabethan Science and Technology THE SCIENTIFIC RENAISSANCE The Middle Ages were not by any means ignorant of science, but its study naturally received a great impetus when the Renaissance brought before educated men all that the Greeks and Romans had done in mathematics, physics, astronomy, medicine, and other subjects. The invention of printing also fostered the scientific revival by making it easy to spread knowledge abroad in every land. The pioneers of Renaissance science were Italians, but students in France, England, Germany, and other countries soon took up the work of enlightenment. COPERNICUS 1473-1543 The names of some Renaissance scientists stand as landmarks in the history of thought. The first place must be given to Copernicus, the founder of modern astronomy. He was a Pole, but lived many years in Italy. Patient study and calculation led him to the conclusion that the earth turns upon its own axis, and, together with the planets, revolves around the sun. The book in which he announced this conclusion did not appear until the very end of his life. A copy of it reached him on his deathbed. THE COPERNICAN THEORY Medieval astronomers had generally accepted the Ptolemaic system. Some students before Copernicus had indeed suggested that the earth and planets might rotate about a central sun, but he first gave reasons for such a belief. The new theory met much opposition, not only in the universities, which clung to the time-honored Ptolemaic system, but also among theologians, who thought that it contradicted many statements in the Bible. Moreover, people could not easily reconcile themselves to the idea that the earth, instead of being the center of the universe, is only one member of the solar system, that it is, in fact, only a mere speck of cosmic dust. GALILEO, 1564-1642 An Italian scientist, Galileo, made one of the first telescopes--it was about as powerful as an opera glass--and turned it on the heavenly bodies with wonderful results. He found the sun moving unmistakably on its axis, Venus showing phases according to her position in relation to the sun, Jupiter accompanied by revolving moons, or satellites, and the Milky Way composed of a multitude of separate stars. Galileo rightly believed that these discoveries confirmed the theory of Copernicus. KEPLER, 1571-1630 Another man of genius, the German Kepler, worked out the mathematical laws which govern the movements of the planets. He made it clear that the planets revolve around sun in elliptical instead of circular orbits. Kepler's investigations afterwards led to the discovery of the principle of gravitation. VESALIUS, 1514-1564 AND HARVEY, 1578-1657 Two other scientists did epochal work in a field far removed from astronomy. Vesalius, a Fleming, who studied in Italian medical schools, gave to the world the first careful description of the human body based on actual dissection. He was thus the founder of human anatomy. Harvey, an Englishman, after observing living animals, announced the discovery of the circulation of the blood. He thereby founded human physiology. THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Vesalius, Harvey, and their fellow workers built up the scientific method. In the Middle Ages students had mostly been satisfied to accept what Aristotle and other philosophers had said, without trying to prove their statements. Kepler, for instance, was the first to disprove the Aristotelian idea that, as all perfect motion is circular, therefore the heavenly bodies must move in circular orbits. Similarly, the world had to wait many centuries before Harvey showed Aristotle's error in supposing that the blood arose in the liver, went thence to the heart, and by the veins was conducted over the body. The new scientific method rested on observation and experiment. Students learned at length to take nothing for granted, to set aside all authority, and to go straight to nature for their facts. As Lord Bacon, one of Shakespeare's contemporaries and a severe critic of the old scholasticism, declared, \"All depends on keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature, and so receiving their images simply as they are, for God forbid that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of the world.\" Modern science, to which we owe so much, is a product of the Renaissance.

            "The value of NYC housing construction starts more than doubled to $1.9 billion in the first half of 2012, hitting a four-year high. In contrast, the value of overall construction starts in the city dropped 16 percent year-over-year, according to a New York Building Congress report released Tuesday. McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge data shows that there were $6.6 billion worth of starts across all construction for the first six months this year, down from $7.9 billion for the same period in 2011. Building Congress president Richard Anderson attributed the dip in overall construction to the non-residential sector, which includes commercial office and retail buildings, public and private schools and cultural/entertainment venues. The value of started projects in this sector fell to $3.2 billion in the first half of 2012 after hitting $6.1 billion in the same six months the previous year. \"While there's no shortage of planned projects, especially in the office sector, we are lacking the type of job growth and confidence in the overall economy that is necessary to get these projects off the ground quickly,\" Anderson said in a statement. However, \"the numbers coming from the residential sector are very encouraging... If you go back to July of 2011, this sector has generated nearly $4 billion in new projects.\" The data covers all project starts in New York City, including new construction, alterations and renovations to existing structures. The numbers reflect the estimated value of each commenced project through the whole construction process. \n",

I've been going to the CIAS for a few years now, but this year I can't justify the time or the expense when all I'm interested in is seeing the F-16 and F-18.

Went out with a friend a few years back and we were way too far out. The show is set up for the people on shore. I've also seen it from the top of the TD centre before the downtown got closed in by newer bigger buildings and while it was too far away you could see the plane do their turn arounds and set ups miles away. TTC to King and Jameson and walk down to the lake. Try to find a spot that hasn't been taken over for parking. Okay, it was better pre nimrod but still I prefer to be out on the water. Maybe I'm just antisocial or something. I trailer down and launch at parklawn. After the show I usually go for a bit of a tour so pulling out isn't an issue. Bring a lunch listen to some tunes and float around, may not be the 'best' seat in the house but it's still my favorite way to watch it. \n",

The rewards for backers are fantastic (a weekend workshop in Soweto with Per-Anders sounds amazing, but a signed print would be a nice compromise if you can't figure out how to get to South Africa right now). Soweto was recently featured on the Lens Blog . Soweto, or southwestern townships, was founded over one hundred years ago outside Johannesburg, South Africa, under British authority. It was established as the first settlement for black and colored people on the outskirts of the city. During that time Africans had been drawn to work on the gold mines near Johannesburg and were accommodated in separate areas on the outskirts of town. The growth of the township of Soweto was accelerated by the increasing eviction of Africans by city and state authorities under the Apartheid regime after 1948. Soweto grewto be the biggest township in the country. Far away from work and housing, the township consisted of hostels for men, simple huts and corrugated tin shacks. Today, Soweto is a development hub and consists of 32 townships and the official population is around one million. Many believe it's much higher, some think as high as 2-3 million. I worked in Soweto for the first time in 1994 while covering the first democratic elections. Soweto has always been my favorite part of Johannesburg. Soweto as a rich history and is infamous for the political violence during the Apartheid struggle. Of those the violent student uprisings in 1976 are maybe most known to foreigners, where students from the township rose up in protest against Afrikaans as the only language used in the education system. The South African regime answered to the protests by shooting at unarmed children dressed in their school uniforms. This event sparked a re-awakening of black resistance and many of the important developments at the time happened in the township. Many of the key players in the struggle era lived and operated out of Soweto. More than 30 years later Soweto is a city of growing enterprises and a wild mix of culture, with several high-end shopping malls, a brand new world class theater, car dealers, parks, improving transport and brand new townhouses and apartments that sell like hot cakes. I have been based in South Africa for the last 10 years and have always gone back to Soweto whenever I could on assignments or to see friends. I am fascinated with his fast changing pace and its growing prosperity. I am now planning to move to Soweto for a couple of months to complete my ongoing project about the rapid changes in South Africa's most famous township. Soweto is seen by many as a model of hope for the new South Africa. It is no longer a place of doom and gloom but a place of hope. It has of course its problems with high levels of poverty, unemployment and crime, but the positive developments are beginning to filter through. The few last years have brought a lot of investments to Soweto and many people now enjoy modern shopping malls, banks, restaurants and trendy bars. Many of the old shacks have been erased and thousands of small government subsidized houses have been built. Because of new investments, many residents of Soweto now start to spend most of their time and money in the township. Most of them still work in Johannesburg, but now they don't have to buy groceries and bring them back in mini bus taxis. More and more people have their own cars and buy everything close to their homes. Soweto has lately been in the midst of a property boom, where every property for sale has several potential buyers and it's usually sold within days. Many newly rich blacks left the township in the 90s for the northern suburbs, where traditionally only affluent whites lived. Many live there in mansions with high walls and tight security. Many only know their neighbors by name. It has been a difficult adjustment for most. Added problems are the high crime rate in affluent suburbs, such as hour breaking and car high-jacking. Many who left miss the vibrant life in the townships and they usually came back to visit on the weekends for family gatherings and funerals, or they just come to wash their new BMWs at a car wash, while having a few beers with their childhood friends in tendy bars. Soweto is increasingly a source for new fashion, art, music styles in South Africa. It is a great microcosm to show the many facets of the new South Africa. I would be very happy to share this journey with you! For serious supporters of this project I will offer a workshop in Soweto where we will live, work and breath in this massive, vibrant place closely. We will also work on a photo project and you will also be able to get a close and unique insight into how I work as a photojournalist. We will be completing projects and I will share my insight and experience of many years of working as a photojournalist around the world. -- Per-Anders Pettersson What started your interest in photography and what led you to photo editing? Well, I kinda fell into it. I dropped out of college and moved to New York, I was working a series of crappy food service jobs. A friend from high school was working at the Saba Agency in the library, refiling slides. I was working at a burrito joint working the takeout counter. I was miserable. When my pal decided to leave his job at Saba to be a waiter and I asked if he could get me in. He marched me into Marcel Saba's office and said \"I'm leaving, but my friend can work here.\" Marcel, surprisingly, said okay. I started refiling 35mm slides, then moved onto cataloguing, then editing, then helping out with production. I loved my job, loved looking at photos. I learned a lot working there with really great, talented people. When People magazine went published a photo of Audrey Hepburn that I researched, I was thrilled! My first job in publishing was with Marianne Butler at Worth . When she left for Men's Health , she took me with her. She really taught me a lot, she had a great eye and was a very exacting boss. Her photo pet peeves are now my pet peeves. I shudder at the word \"shooter\" and cropped out feet makes me crazy. What are some of the best, and hardest aspects of your job? Seeing a great photo is the best part of the job. I love being surprised, I love seeing a story/ portrait turn out different and better than I imagined. The hardest part is when the photo is just okay. All I can hear is that Debbie Downer sound when a shoot is less than expected. So basically its always Christmas. The main wall of Ernie's office. About the wall, Ernie says \"It's a mix of photo/images/people i like, my family and 2 percent cute boys.\" I'm sure you get tons of printed promos, emails and phone calls; what is the best way for a photographer to reach out to you and what are some common mistakes that are made? I don't get as many printed promos pieces anymore. When I do receive one that catches my eye, I'll always check the photographer's website. I do get lots of e-promos and generally just scan the embedded image and make a choice whether to click to the website. I'm more likely to check out the websites of photographer's outside of big cities. I do see a lot of great young photographers whose images are not appropriate for the work I produce -- that can be hard! I will sometimes send an email to let them know how much I admire their work. Promo mistakes... sigh... Always include your location! Photo editors need to know where you are located. If you are a regional photographer your promo should show a wider variety of images, i.e. portraits, reportage... I tend to pass over promo pieces with one image of: landscapes, puppies, children, flowers, a celebrity holding a puppy or a flower... When you get a shoot in, what is your editing process? Do you go by your gut reaction to an image or is your edit based on the text or what your editor has asked for? When a shoot comes in I just go through and make a selects of photos that I like, and then try to strong arm the designers into using the photo that I like best! We work very closely with our editors on the art direction so when the shoot happens all the edit notes have been incorporated into the shoot direction. Photograph by Meredith Jenks Ernie Monteiro started working in photo in the waning days of the age of chrome. She has worked at Worth, Men's Health and is currently at Time Inc. Content Solutions, the custom publishing arm of Time Inc. The amazing Stephen Wilkes will be featured on one of my favorite shows, CBS Sunday Morning (why yes, I am an 85-year-old-gentleman, and proud of it!) this weekend. The focus will be on his Day to Night series and the making of the photographs. If you are lazing about in your pajamas be sure to watch it, Stephen is pretty incredible and inspiring, I can't wait to see it! Aside from photography, were there any other professions that interested you? I started out with the desire to be a computer scientist. Then I explored city planning.  I discovered photography while I was in college, and was inspired to finally find an appropriate tool to simultaneously illustrate the complexities of society and the intricacies of being a human.  I am challenged by the desire to illustrate a clear picture that intertwines both emotion and reality into a method of communication that is understood.  I saw images by Dorthea Lange and felt that images she created were more significant than most anything else in illustrating the dilemma in the U.S. during the Dust Bowl; photography could be a significant and powerful communication tool in society. How influential and beautiful a profession to be able to introduce that level of conversation to the world.

What gave you the idea, how long did you spend shooting and are you curious to revisit those spots again and see if those candidate signs have changed? I'm actually writing this from the road. I left the west coast to follow the same route as I did in 2008 to explore and add depth to the project.  This time I'll be photographing this route twice -- to NY and back.   The interesting twist this time is Sandy. Sandy is the deadly weather event that cancelled my flight east at the beginning of this project, and created havoc for just about everyone on the east coast.  I was supposed to land in Newark on October 28th, the night before the hurricane reached landfall there.  For a while I was unsure if this project was doomed or if there was still a way to make it happen within the limited time available before the election on November 6th, or if the project mattered _at all_ in the scheme of things.  But, here we are, on the road- Day 7 will take us in and out of post-Sandy New York City. The trip in 2008 was a little bit spontaneous.  I came up with the concept when driving from Las Vegas to the Bay Area in late summer 2008 after spotting a Ron Paul sign alongside the freeway in the desert.  The sparseness of the landscape with this sign plopped in the middle; it seemed so insignificant- this name, this sign, politics against the backdrop of the desert sun.  Simultaneously, the radio was underlining the importance of each candidate and how this election was different.  Friends were excitedly arguing about politics. I felt buried beneath this big political bubble and sensed a disconnect signaled by this Ron Paul sign beneath a bright blue sky; the sign almost looked like a piece of garbage left there.  I passed by it once more with the intention of photographing it, and discovered the challenges that came along with photographing signs along a busy freeway. I never got a shot.  But I thought that photographing signs related directly to the two major candidates throughout the United States would make an interesting story if I was able to explore multiple signs in multiple places.  Adding to the depth, stick to a main corridor that divides the country in two -- kind of the way politics seems to divide people into the us and the them; the haves and the have-nots; the right and the left; the rich and the poor; the right and the wrong. There are all these dualities, and then there's the middle road. Several weeks went by and I didn't share my idea with anyone.  Surprisingly, a close friend of mine called me up out of the blue; she had bought a house across the country in Upstate New York to escape the Bay Area for a while. She would be moving sometime in October and needed a driving partner.  Our explorations and teamwork during that trip created the images from 2008.  I wasn't sure how it was going to work out, and then I got the film back. There's something special about photographing the country in the way that I did during that time.  It's a different time now, though it's still quite a powerful time- with much confusion and disappointment and strife.  I feel like this part of the story was missing from 2008. I don't intend to photograph any elections in the future. The 2012 images serve as a bookend to the 2008 images. Interestingly, we are all driven to see similarities or differences in the settings for each sign; we are drawn to trying to find a pattern. Are the signs for the Republican candidate all in rich neighborhoods or on farms? Sometimes.  Is the Democratic sign in front of the working family's little house? Sometimes.  From the road, it is hard to notice a pattern other than the obvious increase in Democratic signage in metropolitan areas.  That is the single noticeable pattern.  All else is unpredictable in terms of the signs that I am looking for. I don't keep numbers, I'm just looking for good photographs. I'm looking for a wide breadth of things that tie in classic American stories, images that illustrate the American landscape on a variety of levels, images that bring me back to that disconnect introduced by the Ron Paul sign in the desert. \n",

            "      2 Turnbull will have to toe party line Story Tools Related Items Liberal MP Malcolm Turnbull has voiced his support for a conscience vote on gay marriage. Cade Mooney A CONSCIENCE vote on gay marriage does not look likely in Federal Parliament leaving Opposition frontbencher and civil unions supporter Malcolm Turnbull with no choice but to follow his party line. Speaking at the Southern Cross University Michael Kirby Lecture Series on the Gold Coast on Friday, Mr Turnbull, who has voiced his support for a conscience vote on the controversial topic, said it did not look likely his leader would change his mind. \"I don't think Mr (Tony) Abbott is likely to change his mind; he has made a decision on that and he has the support of the party room,\" he said. Two bills on civil unions recently went through the parliamentary committee process but are not expected to go before Federal Parliament until the end of the year. Despite the delay, Mr Turnbull is confident federally-recognised civil unions will become a reality. \"While I am very doubtful the numbers are there to legislate for gay marriage in the Federal Parliament I think they are certainly there to legislate for civil unions,\" he said. \"I think it would be a great pity if marriage is not able to be passed in the parliament and that opportunity to pass civil unions should be taken up. \"I think it will be between now and when the parliament is dissolved before the time of the election.\" His remarks follow the Queensland Parliament's controversial move to repeal civil union laws and make surrogacy for same-sex couple illegal. Mr Turnbull would not comment on the moves. The coalition MP was scheduled to give a speech on gay marriage and human rights at the annual lecture last night but was not giving anything away to reporters beforehand. He will be joined by former High Court Justice Michael Kirby, who has been a staunch advocate for gay rights throughout his very accomplished legal career. \n",

            "      2 Just back from our very first safari, which was fabulous beyond belief. I'll post a T.R. once we get reorganized. Before we went, I posted a question asking what things people had wished they had taken with them in hindsight. The answers were pretty much what I expected, nothing out of the ordinary. Here's what I wish I had taken: Ski Goggles If you have eyes that are sensitive to dust, wind or glare, these would be the perfect accessory to take with you. Standing in the Land Cruiser, breezing across the Serengeti, dust everywhere, these would have been perfect. I agree they would work pretty well, but ski goggles would seal out the dust better. Plus, I wear glasses, and the wraparounds don't work real well with them. I have ski goggles that fit over top of my glasses quite nicely. I was lucky to find a pair of wrap around sunglasses at my optomitrist's that fit over my glasses (when I need to wear them). And I had them check them out carefully to make sure the sunglasses were not rubbing on the glass lens. I have them on tethers so that when I need to remove them quickly to take photos, I don't lose them on the floor or sit on them on the seat. Works great with wearing glasses or contacts. I also found that if it is really dusty, like it was one year in March, if I put a couple of drops of eye lubricating solution in each eye every 2 hours, anything that gets in there, floats out easily. \n",
            "      2 It's Obama all the way for Oxford's U.S. expats Buy this photo  Bill Barnard, who was brought up in Alabama and now lives in Oxford, is expecting a close US election next Tuesday IT'S the election which has even got Oxford's best brains baffled. Academics at Oxford University are struggling to predict how next week's American election will pan out. Nigel Bowles, the director of the university's Rothermere American Institute, said: \"It is too close to predict. \"The polls are within the margin of statistical error. \"This race is extraordinarily close and it is not possible to say with any confidence what so ever what the outcome will be.\" Dr Bowles said his colleagues at the institute were having just as much difficulty predicting a result. According to the BBC's most recent poll on Sunday Republican Mitt Romney, below right, is predicted to win 49 per cent of the vote while incumbent Democrat Barack Obama, below left, is predicted to win 47 per cent. Bookmaker William Hill puts Mr Obama as the favourite to win the election, with odds of 1/3 while Mitt Romney is 9/4. Banbury Road resident Bill Barnard, 70, who was brought up in Alabama but has lived in the UK since the late 1990s, is backing Obama. He aid: \"It will be a close election which will come down to the votes in the swing states. Related links \"The expectations of Obama were extraordinarily high and it was inevitable that there would be some disappointment.\" Mary Ann Cardy, 65, who was brought up in Indiana but now lives in Westbury Crescent, Cowley, said: \"The biggest problem in the US is the polarisation. \"I don't know what will happen. \"It's going to be close but I am really hoping that people have sense enough to realised that they need to give Obama another four years. \"I voted for Obama in 2008, but I feel that he reached road blocks with the Republicans in Congress and they weren't willing to compromise.\" Student Eva Lam, 25, of the Oxford branch of Democrats Abroad said: \"I worked on Obama's campaign in 2008. There was a lot of optimism then but it has been replaced by an understanding of the alternative that Romney represents.\" Earlier this year Oxford was one of the few locations in the UK where American Democrats could cast their vote in person for the primary elections to select their candidate. When the primary was held in Oxford in 2008 the city voted for Obama, with 118 votes to Hillary Clinton's 26, and in May, the city again supported Obama with 77 per cent of the vote. The only way for Oxford-based Americans to vote in the Presidential election next Tuesday is by absentee ballot sent electronically. Artist Ted Dewan, who is originally from Boston but now lives in Beechcroft Road, Summertown, said: \"I am definitely going to be voting for Obama again. I am hoping he gets another term because it takes four years to learn the job and another four years to see it through. \"Here in the UK we only have six weeks of electioneering and I am really glad I live here because months of negativity during the campaign really gets to you. \"The thing that bugs me the most is this whole way of pillorying the administration for Obamacare. There are some horror stories about private health insurance and we are so lucky to have the NHS.\" The UK branch of Republicans Abroad did not comment. How the US elections work US presidential elections are held in November every four years, but the process begins in the preceding January when the parties select their candidates in the primary elections. Voters declare support for one party or another during the primaries and select delegates who have pledged to vote for a particular candidate. These delegates gather at the party's national convention and vote for a candidate for that party. On election day itself voters pick members of the electoral college who support their candidate. Each state has a different number of electoral college members depending on its representation in Congress. Candidates with the most votes in each state then win those electors. Electors can in theory vote otherwise -- and are dubbed \"faithless electors\" although this rarely happens. To win the election a candidate needs to win the support of 270 members of the electoral college. The electors then cast their votes in December to elect the President. People living in the UK should be so happy that they do not have the American system of voting, we are bombarded 24 hours a day by tv political adverts,which are nasty, finger pointing, backstabbing, depressing, they are on at nearly every commercial break, the British system means that the Prime Minister calls an election and it is all over and done in one month, over here in the USA this election just like the others have been going on now for two years now. are we are all SICK to death of it, the cost is already over two billion, sad this whoever gets in, the whole thing starts all over again in two years.

            "      2 Hobbit star's Wellington sojourn James Nesbitt, 47, went straight from drama school to a BBC biopic and he has never looked back, becoming a hit in several television shows and movies. But his work/life balance changed dramatically in 2010, when he was cast as Bofur in Sir Peter Jackson's feverishly anticipated adaptation of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit. ''I got a call to read the character of Bofur on tape and it seemed to go quite well, but then I didn't hear anything,'' he recalls. Two months later he met Jackson and his partner Fran Walsh. At that stage there was no script and Jackson wasn't even sure he would direct the film. After a long delay, Nesbitt had ''kind of forgotten about it. Then I was offered the part. I didn't see it as life changing. For me, it was just a fantastic opportunity''. But life changing it was. The job took him to New Zealand and he uprooted his family for the duration. It could have been a disaster. ''My daughters [Peggy and Mary] were absolutely f...... devastated,'' says Nesbitt. ''It was the worst. But then we got out to Wellington and I had some time to spend with them before I started filming.'' His daughters were also given the benefits of an idyllic-sounding Kiwi schooling. If it was hot, classes would take place on the beach. How conducive was that to studying? ''It was a very good education, actually,'' explains Nesbitt. ''They don't have the same notion of targets, or the obsession with exams, or the same nightmare amount of homework. It was also very multicultural; I mean, we live in London, which is a multicultural city, but I think my girls lead pretty cosseted lives. ''In New Zealand, they got involved in Maori culture, and the relationship between the whites and the indigenous people felt very harmonious.'' Was it hard to leave? ''Peggy said to me recently that it was the best thing that ever happened to her,'' says Nesbitt, smiling, ''but that she was pleased to be back.'' Nesbitt made some close friends among the cast. He describes Sir Ian McKellen, who plays Gandalf, as ''funny and generous'', while Martin Freeman, in the lead role of Bilbo Baggins, is ''a young lead shouldering huge responsibilities, but being witty and collaborative at the same time''. Of course, this could all sound like thespian blub, except Nesbitt doesn't seem like the sort of person to tolerate that kind of talk. ''The fact is that we really had to become very close to make everything work. Me and the other dwarfs - Aidan Turner, Dickie Armitage - I suppose we were trying to achieve a level of brotherhood. In the film we are on a quest and it was kind of the same when we were filming. ''There were times when it was tough,'' he says. ''It could be incredibly gruelling. There were long days, we were moving around a lot. We would spend hours in prosthetics and then film these long battle sequences ...'' Nesbitt's soft voice trails off and I wonder whether he is already feeling nostalgic for his band of brothers. Certainly, he's convinced of the wow factor of the entire production. ''It was incredible being taken from location to location by helicopter. And when you get there, the whole thing is huge. They have created this entirely Tolkien world. We had glass-blowers and mechanics on set all dedicated to this fantasy vision. I have seen quite a lot of the film already and it is incredible.'' When I suggest The Hobbit could turn Nesbitt into a big Hollywood name, he looks daunted. ''I think it's fair to say that the world will be watching. Air New Zealand is running a big advertisement across its planes with a picture of Bilbo Baggins and us dwarfs with a tag underneath saying 'Air New Zealand, the airline of Middle-earth'.'' Sunday Telegraph THE DETAILS: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has its world premiere in Wellington on November 28 and opens on December 13. \n",
            "      2 David Icke has fallen into the trap of using the same fear thinking that he so noisily opposes ! There he goes attacking the establishment for paedophilia, asserting to them and to us \"don't do as you're told, be moral instead\"... Well to that I would ask \"Is morality the criteria to use, when the morality he is talking about has been inflicted on us by hireling social workers and churchmen? Normal morality surely is just more of doing what you're told..\" Consider, ask yourself what *is* paedophilia, what does the term mean, and do we use it that way? What term would we be using without social workers setting out to be policemen of our morality? In my experience \"paedophile\" is just a term of abuse. In the 19th century in America the equivalent deadly term was \"Horse thief\"! Lets unload that terror-inspiring language fellas! Up until the mid-twentieth century it was common practice for whole families to sleep in the same 8-foot wide bed. Same with the narrow boats on the canals where adults and children slept either in the same bed or in very close proximity. Doubtless the children will have watched their parents making love from close-to. And who is to say what touching went on in those beds? Those children will have become sexually aware, if not sexually awakened, and probably that will have had a bonding effect on the family and arguably did not damage the children. But in stepped the social workers and forbade... You look at the games that were played - \"British Bulldog\" and many others where picking each other up and holding them off the floor for a few seconds was the aim. Such games are forbidden now... Forbidden by social workers, and our norms have changed. Look at the guiding terminology used by ordinary people a century ago. It wasn't \"sexual abuse\" or \"paedophilia\", it was \"interfering\" (invasive sexual touching), or \"molesting\" (troubling the spirit of a child). All that changed, particularly in the mid-1980s when social workers, afraid of being handbagged by Maggie's cuts, drummed up a huge scare about paedophile bogeymen in order to keep themselves securely employed... So I would posit that what was guiding behaviour within families *prior* to social worker interference was not obedience, not morality, but basically a blessing where parents involved the children closely in their lives, they functioned as a family team, and children had an implicit blessing where they were wanted to grow up healthy and strong... Such families also displayed self-reliance, independence from the external heirarchy, and loyalty towards each other. Having been myself brought up in care of the Church of England Children's Society where all sexuality, all making friendships at all were actively suppressed by the houseparents of the children's home, I can say that the effect was sexual inhibition and social avoidance in adult life where I nowadays live as a hermit - largely unable to form relationships. The children's homes were closed down precisely to stop the damaging social effects they were causing. The boarding grammar school I went to became grossly homosexual with more than half the boys engaging in homosexuality, encouraged by one or two teachers. So those who pretend to be teaching us how to live, did and do *not* have that blessing within them that we should grow up strong and healthy - they are just selfish hirelings who want to avoid scandal and have a nice job... Many of our politicians come from such schools, so perhaps we should have room in our hearts to pity them. Also do you recall Michael Jackson dangling his infant son over the balcony held by the ankle? That was a compliance-taunt phenomenon where Michael was so frightened, so self-conscious from the screaming hatred of the mass media trouncing he was getting, that he started hypnotically responding to the coercion to behave like a child abuser. Basically he was reactively interpreting the hate-talk as a command to *be* a child abuser, and also to display his anger... Had he continued in life much longer he was in danger of becoming a real paedophile because not being allowed to be anything else.. (In the middle ages it was observed that people on their way to be burned alive following torture and condemnation as witches, behaved like witches. They had NOT been witches prior to the torture...) Social workers, the press, police too make their living from inciting fear, from creating dragons.. That fear has even contaged into the Care Leavers Association, created by care alumni, run by care alumni for care alumni. The guy who runs it was witnessed by me inhibiting all formation of friendships or sexual relationships and instead trouncing and dominating everything, until the officers and members of that Association were conditioned into seeking his permission to exist from minute to minute... (That Association has set up a daughter association; the Jersey Care Leavers Association. I shudder.) The result of making dragons is nuclear families of one or two parents being the child's whole world, where aunts and uncles are avoided, fearing the paedophile spectre. (It took an educational psychologist whose job involves spotting child abuse to put a counter to that fear-thinking. What he said to me was that its the child of a single parent or nuclear family who is in danger. That the people who most abuse children are likely to be their own birth parents. The safe child has lots of aunts and uncles they can talk to, copy role models from, and stay with at choice, lots of people, adults, siblings cousins and friends who can pick them up, hold and wrestle with them.) Another result of making paedo dragons is that people in general cannot maintain relationships and less than half the population have married. That is IMHO product of social deprivation, a dearth of relatives and friends in childhood. Lets consider the scene with the politicians of the New World Order and the paedo-honey-trapping being used on them. Make a frontal attack on them for paedophilia and all you will do is give fire to the dragons -- reinforcing the terrorism thats holding them in compliance. And of course they will close ranks to defend themselves, then they must turn their power-wheels and silence you... I support exposing their networks, but please don't load fire into your language.. Then lets consider the action of creating and putting fire into paedo fear dragons inside yourself.. Those two-minute hate sessions of vids and articles exposing paedos that you cannot touch, has for effect of building up hatred within yourself. David Icke was happy to trounce the religionists for generating and corralling spiritual energy in religious services, but here he is doing the same, generating and corralling low-frequency hate energy ready to direct destructively just by use of the trigger word \"Paedophile\". Having been myself on the receiving end of such hatred, undeserved by me, I can state from experience that the haters *WANT* to hate; they only want the permission to hate in order to unleash their mischief, and they will actively resist being told any disconfirming evidence - indeed will destroy evidence that proves the target's innocence. And hatred gets to be familiar, like a some well-worn jacket, so that people learn to love to hate... It is characteristic for witch hunting and gang-stalking that people targeted for this mischief are people on the margins of society, victims, not perps, and in the witch hunting the real villains get actively shielded. So get into hatemongering and you are in danger of missing the mark... (Nothing new about that, and in visiting Rome's Coliseum this last month I was struck to discover how the population loved to watch murder and destruction in this free-to-enter stadium). Might it be better, think you, to stop invoking that dragon of fear, stop playing their game by their rules ? A little bit more about morality.. Moral codes are tribal - they reflect the values of the chosen group. Thus criminals have different mores than ordinary people, gays have different sexual mores, police and soldiers also have different mores (which can be interpreted as type 2 psychopathy), and ruling oligarchs have a different set of moral rules too.. Star Trek somewhat explored these mores where with the Klingons, Ferengi, Vulcans and so forth they separated sub-tribes within our culture into distinct species and then explored their moral outworkings... I would invite that we explore what we call \"normal\" past and present, examine what it is we consider to be \"inside the box\" and WHETHER IT BELONGS THERE. If we are to function from love instead of fear, we have to look at how love outworks in our lives, and at who and where that fear is being incited, and make our changes. 1. Our sense of morality, i.e. paedophiles being a bad thing, is false because it's the result of peer pressure from social workers 2. Because fear has such a negative effect we should stop exposing the paedophiles in the elites 3. We should feel sorry for the paedophiles because their actions are obviously the product of childhood abuse Ok, here's the deal - you seem to think paedophilia is the equivalent of a victorian family sharing a bed... Our head judges, police and parliamentarians are all freemasons - they're in a cult. And since the beginning they have kidnapped, raped and murdered children... Why? Well I can't think like the sick elitest scum that run this country, but according to your logic, morality is just another form of control - they can do whatever the hell they like! The reason people frown upon old men holding their children down and... Wow, do I really need to explain this? But maybe we should ignore it, since 'fear thinking' is so damaging. We have good reason to fear, these freaks control everything - even the media, who seem desperate to supress the story. This isn't like 9-11 where fear of terrorism was used as a means of control... I don't get what you mean - yes the paedophilia thing is generating fear, fear for our children's safety, and hopefully the people will finally act out against the corruption of the government! I liked the bit where you said we should 'pity' the paedophiles, since they've had such a hard time of it... I'm sorry but I really don't give a fuck. Getting abused as a child does not give you liscence to be the abuser. what is paedophilia you ask? i consider it to be coerced sexual activity with children, the stuff with savile seems to have involved a lot of coercion. i wouldn't consider a 15 year old and 17 year old in a relationship to be paedophile by nature. i think people like glitter should get a minimum life sentence without parole at the least. \"1. Our sense of morality, i.e. paedophiles being a bad thing, is false because \"it's the result of peer pressure from social workers Morality is a somewhat arbitrary and changeable rule set, and I think the loading was incited by vested interests. I am trying to assess what should be our normal thinking, becaause the present blacker-than-black or whiter-than-white emotive stuff is insane! \"2. Because fear has such a negative effect we should stop exposing the \"paedophiles in the elites No. Expose - and I think the David Icke website is doing a superb job on that. Also something came into view as I wrote my post - that the dragons are not fear, they are, whats the word, memes? They are constructs in our minds that we charge with energy. And what worries me about them is that those dragon demons can guide people to harm the innocent, going on personal experience. \"3. We should feel sorry for the paedophiles because their actions are \"obviously the product of childhood abuse The books say there are two causes - innate, and contagion of aberration (the ipso-facto factor). If it is the latter, then healing the abuser of their trauma is very likely to end offending by them. I have no solution for the former type. The problem is that people are wanting to \"get\" paedos and not to protect children, they in their eagerness to condemn, hurt the wrong people, they protect the real villains in doing so, and they actually create abusers.. Thats why \"dragons\" is a fair description. \"Ok, here's the deal - you seem to think paedophilia is the equivalent of a \"victorian family sharing a bed... No I am not saying that. \"Our head judges, police and parliamentarians are all freemasons - they're in \"a cult. And since the beginning they have kidnapped, raped and murdered \"children... Why? Well I can't think like the sick elitest scum that run this \"country, but according to your logic, morality is just another form of control If I had my way I would close down the Church of England, and the Royal Family, because they have very badly damaged my life. But you can pretend the opposite if you want to listen to your dragons instead of think... The head of the Church of England Children's Society is the Duchess of Gloucester. A former Duke of Gloucester as president of the C-Soc had openly advocated the child migrations which caused immense suffering for tens of thousands of children and created a culture of official mendacity which persists within the C-Soc to this day. That culture of lying into children's records is still there, and it directly affected me. - they can do whatever the hell they like! Not if I can help it ! I liked the bit where you said we should 'pity' the paedophiles, since they've had such a hard time of it... Actually David Icke said that too. I'm sorry but I really don't give a fuck. Getting abused as a child does not give you liscence to be the abuser. \"what is paedophilia you ask? i consider it to be coerced sexual activity with children, the stuff with savile seems to have involved a lot of coercion. i wouldn't consider a 15 year old and 17 year old in a relationship to be paedophile by nature. Coerced. Thats helpful. \"i think people like glitter should get a minimum life sentence without parole at the least. Glitter's abuse involved one evening with two kids where he didn't physically injure them. How about my children's home houseparents - no sexual abuse but they continuously verbally bullied me, threatening me with police, courts, prosecutions, convictions, birchings, borstal and prison. (because I was frightened of police as symbolic of the sadistic bullying of my father, always done on judgemental pretexts..) They socially excluded me - I was never once allowed to use the play shed where the toys and games were. They lied about me into my file. They encouraged staff to pick me up off the ground by my ear. Their effect on me was suicidal ideation and attempting suicide, paranoid psychosis, soaring mood swings, and dissociated states with amnesia, hypermnesia and multiple personalities manifesting. Do you think that because their abuse wasn't sexual then they don't deserve same as you think meet for Gary Glitter? You see if you concentrate on the sexual, then you are IMHO being guided by dragons in your mind-functioning. well, i myself have been subjected to physical and psychological abuse, but my answer to the question of what is paedophilia is my own personal interpretation of what i believe it is and obviously other people have differing opinions. personally i hate all sex cases, not just kiddy fiddlers, i consider them to be the scum of the earth, but this is just my own personal opinion of course. \n",

            "      1 Zoe and Andy Clark-Coates with their children. Photograph: Sam Frost for the Guardian Zoe Clark-Coates remembers the moment a scan showed that her second pregnancy , like her first, had ended. \"I'll never forget the midwife's face as she looked at the screen. She fell completely silent and I started screaming -- a terrible, almost primal reaction over which I had no control. Looking back, I feel sorry for all those women sitting in the waiting room who were forced to listen to such an ordeal.\" What Zoe didn't know was that she and her husband, Andy, would have the same experience again. In the space of three and a half years, the couple, both 36, have lost five pre-term babies: Coby, Bailey, Darcy, Samuel and Isabella. Each baby was named, loved and mourned. Today, Zoe and Andy have two daughters, Esme, aged three and Bronte, eight months. But Zoe regards herself as a mother of seven, not as a mother of two. \"I don't want to forget the babies who were never born. They will always be a part of me,\" says Zoe. Coping after a miscarriage can be extremely difficult for both parents. \"People often underestimate the level of trauma,\" Zoe says. \"Each time I've lost a baby, I've felt I might die with the pain. The grief was suffocating. It's overwhelming having to decide on the spot whether you want an autopsy or the body released to you. Not being able to face going to bed at night, knowing you're going to have to go through the anguish of the following day. And there's this terrible fear that you might never be a mother at all,\" she says. She and Andy felt keenly that unlike the death of a person who has lived some kind of life -- even if only for a few days after birth -- there is no ritual public acknowledgment of the loss of a life. \"When you miscarry, there's no funeral and no way of saying goodbye,\" says Zoe. Knowing that thousands of women miscarry, or experience stillbirth, she and Andy came up with an idea -- a way for grieving couples to experience closure. Under the name Saying Goodbye, they have organised cathedral services in various cities in mainland Britain this summer -- London, Exeter, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Manchester. Everyone involved has donated their time -- and contributions in kind -- including clergymen and women, organists, choirs, florists and printers. Parents will be invited to light a candle at the service to commemorate their loss. With the backing of the Miscarriage Association, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, Zoe was able to approach numerous cathedrals. \"Their response was amazing,\" she says. \"They immediately said this was exactly the kind of thing they should be doing, that there was such a need.\" The services are Church of England but people of every denomination and faith are welcome. Half of the funds raised by the event will be donated to the cathedrals, but there will be no charge for their use. Cathedrals were chosen because of their size -- big enough, it's expected, to seat everyone who wants to attend. The first service will be held in Exeter, in July -- Zoe and Andy will stand alongside other bereaved parents,to say goodbye to their unborn babies. \"The services are a wonderful opportunity for mothers and fathers to say that their babies are truly loved and will always be missed.\" Saying Goodbye will offer parents an occasion on which to focus their grief. \"Andy and I want to be able to lay to rest the babies we've lost, in a sense, and to help others do the same,\" Zoe says. \"Every child deserves to be recognised, however fleeting its existence.\" As Ruth Bender-Atik, managing director of the Miscarriage Association, says, \"Miscarriage is, sadly, a common experience -- an estimated one in four pregnancies end this way. Couples can feel shock, grief and loss, yet there is something in our culture that makes us draw a veil over the sadness and urge people to move on. \"Even a very early miscarriage represents the loss of a baby and all the accompanying hopes, dreams and plans, but that sense of loss can stay hidden, unrecognised, even minimised by others. The Saying Goodbye services offer parents the opportunity to mark publicly these briefest of lives.\" The last three and a half years have presented Zoe and Andy with more than their fair share of sadness. The miscarriage in 2007 was only picked up at a scan -- the foetus had appeared healthy at earlier examinations. After her worst fears were confirmed, Zoe was given the option of a medical procedure, but decided to go into labour naturally at home. It is a choice she regrets. \"Waiting a week for labour to start was just horrendous,\" says Zoe. \"There was this nagging, irrational hope that there had been a mistake with the scan. And once the process did start it was so painful, so distressing.\" Then, late in 2010, the couple waited until Christmas Eve to tell their families that they were expecting once again. Everyone was euphoric. But when Zoe went upstairs, only moments later, she started bleeding. The ensuing days, with limited access to medical help, compounded the torment. \"One doctor told me there was no point having a scan -- that I'd definitely miscarried,\" Zoe recalls. But the couple demanded proof and 13 long days later were able to book an appointment for a scan. To their amazement, it showed that Zoe had been carrying twins and while one had died, the remaining twin was healthy. They were jubilant, but their joy was short-lived: within a few weeks Zoe was diagnosed with an infected gallbladder and faced life-threatening surgery that could have put her and the unborn child at risk. By the time she was 12 weeks pregnant, she was bedridden, unable to eat and hunched over in pain. An ultrasound scan showed that her gallbladder was full of stones, and had collapsed. It would be a week after a successful operation to remove the gallbladder before Zoe and Andy could be assured that Bronte had survived. \"Each time we've conceived, I haven't allowed myself to believe it was real -- with everything that went on with my previous pregnancies, I couldn't rest until I was finally able to hold Bronte in my arms,\" says Zoe. \"When you have recurrent losses and are told your baby has passed away, you feel that you've just run a marathon and are being sent back to the start again. You're back with the charts, monitoring ovulation; the pregnancy tests, which are, at one and the same time, terrifying and exciting; the calendar counting the days until your baby reaches viability. Not until delivery can you start to entertain the possibility that you might be going home with a newborn baby,\" she says. Zoe still grieves but has transformed her pain into something positive, in the form of Saying Goodbye. \"I believe everything happens for a reason,\" she says. \"It would be a fitting tribute to [the babies] if the anguish we've endured could help others. I hope the services will give families closure and enable them to see the possibility of light at the end of the tunnel.\" Years of loss mean that Zoe appreciates every moment of motherhood. \"I don't even mind the sleepless nights,\" she says. \"What I've been through makes me embrace being a mother. In my darkest moments, I started to wonder whether it was just not meant to be. Even now, I still feel complete elation that I'm finally a mum.\" Comments I know that this is going to be controversial, but this increasing trend worries me. Not in a 'they should keep it to themselves' kind of way - I have no problems at all with listening to a bereaved Mother (or Father) talk about their lost baby. It's part of my job (I'm a funeral director) and I will do whatever I can to help them to work through their loss in those first harsh weeks and months and I feel privileged to be able to do that. No - my worry is whether the modern way of - well - 'dwelling' for years is necessarily very healthy. Back in the 60's a miscarried or stillborn child was simply removed and never to be discussed again - leaving millions of women (and men of course) suffering emotional pain and unable to express it - emotionally damaging we said ... yet the vast majority of these parents moved on and got on with their lives. The pain was still there but tucked away and not dwelt on. It wasn't crippling. Nowadays we are more enlightened ... photographs, memory boxes, remembrance services, online child loss forums, indoor memory corners ... and talking, oh the talking. It seems to me that it all to often serves to keep the pain fresh and raw - it overtakes lives for years with no end in sight ...and worst of all, living children are often almost ignored in the obsession with the lost. I know many families who's children's lives are punctuated with bi-weekly trips to cemeteries, with balloon releases for birthdays, due dates, anniversaries and so on. Who are taken to shops to choose grave gifts for Christmas and encouraged to light candles at a myriad of events such as described ATL. I can't help but wonder what message these children are hearing about their own value and what good it's ultimately doing for these families as a whole. Having lost severel babies myself, I am delighted the Guardian have featured an article like this, seeing how 2 people have turned their grief into something so positive is amazing. Sadlly the views like those expressed by littlemissmolly are few and far between, and only someone who have NEVER lost a child would think those things, let alone post them. Having myslef gone on to have 2 children, I can assure you, anyone who has lost a baby, appreciates their living children even more than most, as we appreciate how fragile life can be. It is crucial to grieve and by attending a service such as those promoted in the article, parents will know they are in a safe place to do so . I agree it is not healthy to remain stuck in grief, people must move forward with their lives, and by properly grieving, the hope would be that they can hold onto any good memories, and move into a place of peace, and remember their child with a smile, rather than trhough tears. My children truly understand how cherished they are, they have seen us go through a lot of loss, and by seeing this they can see how they, and every child is valued, which is quite the opposite of them questioning their own worth. Well done on a sensitive piece that reflects the ongoing trauma of recurrent miscarriage. Littlemissmolly, I think you make a good point, but perhaps miss the point of the Saying Goodbye idea. The unique difficulty with miscarriage is that there is often nothing tangible for your grief. I felt, after three miscarriages, one of which was very late in the pregnancy, that I was left with little ghostly scans but that was it. I lost three of my children but there were no photographs of their smiles, no little mementos of their short lives, in fact there was no mention of them outside my relationship with my husband. In the awful, sickening days after painfully giving birth to your dead baby (and that is what so often happens), you are left with a sense that they never existed at all and the grief is not valid. I think that funerals, flowers, memory boxes, planting trees and all the other modern expressions of grief help make it real. Even the tiny coffin and the cremation with just me and my husband was dreadful as it was wonderful. It gives you a chance to say, without grabbing strangers in the street and yelling it into their faces, \"this really happened, these were my children and they are dead\". Perhaps it is part of a cynical industry of grief; and it may draw out the raw pain of loss. But having lost my precious babies, I am guessing that pain will remain raw and fresh for years - and a remembrance service might just ease that a little and help me \"move on\" (even if that's years later.). I remember just wanting there to be something physical to pour my pain into and feeling some acknowledgement within the family silence that it was acceptable to not want to live without my children. My husband dedicated trees in the fertility forest for our babies, and if that sounds like a dwelling unnecessarily then fuck it, I don't care. It made me feel better. When I read the article I felt at last somebody understands, at last somebody feels how I feel. Having lost babies and seen friends go through similar loss, the level of grief is indescrible. The services described seem to provide an ideal platform to remember and find support at whatever stage of grief you are going through (and believe me, there are many!). Its not about re-hashing the memories and grief over and over, its about there being no memories, and only sadness.....I know for me and my family, it will allow a line to be drawn in the sand. Its time the UK acknowledged the scale of miscarriage, and the harrowing affect on so many of our lives. littlemissmollie I understand your point of view, but for some parents it works. I have lost two babies (one of whom had a surviving twin, my beautiful daughter) in the last five years and have two gorgeous children with another on the way. I too consider myself to have mothered (soon to be) five children. My local hospital - Homerton Hospital in Hackney, London - were truly amazing and every year hold a baby loss rememberance service. I've been twice to remember my two lost children. It was an extremely painful and raw service but one which my husband and I deemed necessary to attend. I was extremely grateful for the hospital holding it - there were leaders from different faiths, midwives and counsellors attending too, some of whom I knew and the fact it was held in the hospital where my babies were lost was special and comforting too. I haven't felt the need to go on an annual basis as my grief is now put in a special place and comes out again from time to time. Kathy , is this something you are planning on working with in conjunction with hospitals? Many women may not know about these services, so I hope you get the word out to the relevant depts in hospitals and GP surgeries. Until Rachel-Eloise was still born to my elder daughter at 8 months gestation, 5 years ago this last week, I had not personally met with the trauma and devastation of miscarriage atall, and had no knowledge or understanding about the being sent home, directly after receiving the worst news of your life, to await the onset of labour several days later - it remains indescribable in its awfulness and sense of desolation, and of course the utter helplessness in being unable to take away my daughter's anguish. Unlike so many in the past who have never known what happened to their baby's remains, ( I discovered a friend for whom this is still the case some 30+ years later) Rachel-Eloise was buried in our village church-yard, following a sensitively led funeral service, and this remains the place that marks her brief existence in utero, and where family can pause to remember, and where also a 'sibling' foetus was also placed at 17 weeks gestation some two years later. My daughter still has no children but she was able to say 'good bye' to those she carried and were part of her life if ever so briefly, and that rite of passage was so very important in the healing process that has allowed her to move on with her life, and to remain hopeful that one day she may still be a parent - we wait in hope and wish those in similar circumstances, peace and hope for the future and thank Zoe and Andy for their inspirational actions which have been born of personal grief and understanding of a little talked about area of life. Thank you for the piece, and raising awareness of the issue, particularly the good work of the Miscarriage Association. I had a molar pregnancy (maybe a piece on this in the future?) diagnosed in January which felt like the end of my world. I'm coming through the other side, and luckily remain treatment free, but I'll never forget that it has happened to me and what I have lost. Although I had a complete mole I hope to do something to mark my loss nearer the time of what would have been my due date. Your story has given me hope as I still can't imagine conceiving a normal pregnancy, let alone carrying a baby to term. I would like to take this opportunity to say 'thank you' to all who have organised these services. I think they offer an incredible opportunity for all who have lost babies during pregnancy or shortly after birth to join with others who understand and to be able to say 'Goodbye' You never forget, but it will help to ease the pain. Agreed, the pain of losing a child at whatever stage is certainly something that never leaves. However, being able to have two healthy children is something wonderful and not something that every couple achieves. Having worked in cultures where babies are dying constantly and mothers are just thankful to get them through the first few months, we need to be conscious of what we have and not what's always missing. If it helps this couple to organise such events, then good luck to them......it is very personal but I believe, be conscious of the past but thankful for the present.......many cannot conceive and have never been near enough to say hello, never mind goodbye. Having lost a niece to stillbirth (2 weeks short of full term) 4 years ago, I have an appreciation for what this couple are doing, but I have to say that they appear to have forgotten those families who have no religious faith. Losing your child doesn't hurt any less if you're in that situation. These services are available to everyone to go and say goodby according to the website whatever your beliefs. I have been a counsellor for many years and have discovered so many women who are depressed but do not know why. Many discover it started with miscarriage. They were told to get over it and try again. However they felt guilty for being so sad. The grief gets internalised when there is no opportunity to even say goodbye. Grief needs some form of closure and this could help so many people. Well done to the couple who are reaching out to help others process their hidden trauma. I have never been pregnant, let alone lost a child, so I can't even begin to imagine the pain many of you have experienced. But I have watched a cousin break her heart. She wasn't told after the birth of her son that her womb was too \"unstable\" to carry another child - each doctor who could or should have told her blamed the others - and so fell pregnant again. After her first scan, she was referred back to her doctor who told her that carrying another baby would endanger her life and said a termination was her only option. The induced labour (as she couldn't face the process of a clinic termination) and sent her home. No support was offered, it was as though she had had a tooth pulled. Her husband was devastated, too, as he had come to fatherhood late (my cousin already had a thirteen year old) but loved being a dad. They had both been so excited to have another child between them. I felt so angry with so many of our family members, who said \"oh dear, so sad\", \"you've got children! Plenty of women would love to be in your position!\" (in physical and emotional agony? Really?) then moved on. Others said \"aww, at least it wasn't losing a baby, just a little collection of cells\". Isn't that all we ever are? I hated the idea that a pregnancy a few weeks longer meant more than hers. Her life was falling apart and people barely took notice. So I thank you, deeply and truly, for creating this network and these events. For my cousin and all of my relatives and friends who have suffered such losses. People should be able to grieve for every life they love that is lost, and be supported in doing so. I believe that your work will salve many hearts and souls xxx I've lost 7 pregnancies since I was in my mid-teens, the joy of PCOS. Like many women I went through them alone, several times without telling anyone. I've been lucky enough that they were early, all but one before the 12 week scan. In a strange way it helped knowing that my Mum, her Sisters and my Gran had lost pregnancies in the past. But I've never properly been able to grieve for any of them. One was following being raped, which was too traumatic for words, as well as losing one in the midst of a horrific break-up with someone who I'd been trying to have a child with for 5 years. The comments from people saying what a relief it must be in the circumstances etc left me speechless. I still barely talk about the experiences, it hurts too much. I live just around the corner from the Edinburgh Cathedral being used. I'll finally be able to go with my teenage son (I've managed to have one viable pregnancies, I was truly blessed with that) and my partner to say goodbye to all of those lost lives, the lost opportunities and the lost futures I could have had. I totally agree with MelissaSmith Well done to this couple! Most people would find it hard to get over the amount of losses they have endured, but this couple clearly treasure the 2 children they have, and also want to help the thousands of women and men who go through this loss weekly. I feel so sad that anyone could post anything remotely negative, if you dont feel a service like this is necessary, then its clearly not something you understand or need. Anyone who has lost one or more children, as I have, or anyone who has supported a family member or friend through loss (as I have), knows these services are desperately needed. I would also like to say how wonderful it is to hold them in cathedrals, so often services such as this are not publicised, and so those who need to attend dont even know about them. By holding them in such large spaces means greater numbers will be able to attend. Having seen the websites I see they are free to attend as well, which means anyone can go along whatever their financial position. Its also refreshing to see top medical experts coming out and saying how needed these services are, and how important it is to support people who have lost a baby....so well done Robert Winston! (comment on Saying Goodbye website). One of the best pieces of advice I've been given - after being upset at how society so resolutely refuses to acknowledge some forms of unhappiness and the impacts of random negative life events - is that if society won't give you what you want, then you have to get on giving it to yourself. Such as suitable ways of dealing with grief like these probably. It was Caitlin Moran who described the resolute societal refusal to let people discuss their unborn children as a form of mental illness. She was talking about termination of course: the one form where society does the total opposite and endlessly goes on about how much those affected must be suffering and how traumatic and life-changing (for the worse) it is. @annifa - I'd not heard of molar pregnancy until now and goodness it sounds utterly horrendous. Good luck in your recovery. I agree with littlemissmolly on this one - it's obviously a positive thing that we have moved on from a time when miscarried and stillborn babies were never mentioned again, and perhaps the pendulum has to swing far the other way before settling at a reasonable midpoint, but I do feel that sometimes our culture of excess has spilled over into this part of life too. I had a son who died suddenly in labour at 42 weeks, and have gone on to have 3 more children, as well as 2 miscarriages, so I have some experience in this area. When my baby died it felt like the end of the world, and in a sense it was - for a time. There were very dark days, desperate thoughts, utter loneliness, and prams, prams everywhere. I was pregnant again 8 months later, and when my stillborn baby's first birthday came around I was exactly 20 weeks pregnant with his brother. And at that point, there was a healthy shift in my head - the palpable baby inside needed all my attention now, and as the miniature daffodils flowered on Joshua's grave on that first birthday, I knew we would all be fine, that life was going on, as it always had and always would. As the years have passed I am so sorry for all that he missed, and always wonder what he would have been like, what he would be doing now....and he will always be an acknowledged and visible part of the family, his little baby photo up there with his siblings. He is part of all our lives. We moved away from the area 7 years later, but not before the babies' area of the cemetery had been subject to an explosion of picket fences, fancy gravel, all kinds of toys, windmills, you name it, and I regretted the tranquillity lost in such a busy scene....each to his own, of course, but I'm sure there was unspoken pressure on parents to conform once this began to happen, and even to compete, a little. That's what it looked like, anyway, as a visitor. I have occasionally browsed the forums on the SANDS website, and have seen a parallel tendency there - a predominant tone of almost strident grief, coupled with euphemisms when referring to the lost babies that jarred horribly for me, and - quite disturbingly - public profile photos which showed miscarried babies, some well under the viable age for preterm babies, which could have been very upsetting for bereaved parents who had chosen not to see their own baby or who just found the images distressing. Just too much. I do think that occasional services to celebrate and acknowledge all our babies are appropriate, and these are not a new idea. While we lived in Bristol I attended several at Cotham Parish Church, always packed and very emotional. Every parent was given a flower and a label to attach to it with their baby's name, and at a point in the service these were carried up and laid in a basket at the altar - one time my 4 year old son very seriously placed our flower there, for his brother, and as we turned back down the nave of the church a hand reached out from a pew and squeezed mine - it was the wonderful and compassionate professor of obstetrics, Gordon Stirratt, who had cared for me beautifully through my third pregnancy, and who was there as a speaker. That's when I cried. I think what this forum shows is that every person has a different view. As someone who has not only had my own personal loss, but also one who supports others through grief on a regular basis, I know I need these services and many others will feel the same. Most people dont have a photo to place with other family shots, all we have is a scan (if we are are lucky). Most of us dont even have a shoulder to cry on, as people simply dont know how to support someone who has lost a child thats never been physically seen by the world. Whilst I can agree that somethings can seem extreme (such as grave stones being decorated with items), who are we to judge how another grieves, who are we to say whats right? Whats important is coming through the other side, and sadly I know many people never do come through it, as they dont grieve like they should for there loss. I hope that by being allowed to grieve at a formal service will be a turning point for many. I know there have been services held around England like this before, but there is nothing very visable, and nothing been talked about nationally. I would like to thank the Guardian for bringing this new organisation into the spotlight, as without it many may have not found out about them, and now we know where to look. Thank You - You said it so much better than I did! Yes - this is exactly what I mean ... not that parents shouldn't feel able to talk about their lost children, or grieve, or even that there is somehow a 'right' way to grieve and a set amount of time to do it in. Of course the pain never goes away and your child is never forgotten and should never, ever, be somehow secret or not spoken of. I'm sure there was unspoken pressure on parents to conform once this began to happen, and even to compete, a little. That's what it looked like, anyway, as a visitor. I have occasionally browsed the forums on the SANDS website, and have seen a parallel tendency there - a predominant tone of almost strident grief, coupled with euphemisms when referring to the lost babies that jarred horribly for me, and - quite disturbingly - public profile photos which showed miscarried babies, some well under the viable age for preterm babies, which could have been very upsetting for bereaved parents who had chosen not to see their own baby or who just found the images distressing. Just too much. I was recently reading about the 9/11 hoaxer and the phrase 'hierarchy of grief' kept cropping up and it instantly struck me that this was almost exactly what I was seeing on various parenting forums I frequent in respect of 'Angel Mummies' (one of the more frequent euphemisms) . There is also a fair amount of hostility to those who don't 'conform' to the accepted pattern, which I find sad . But what concerns me is that it seems to feed on itself ... instead of the talking being a catharsis and helping the bereaved Mother to heal as much as she can, it all too often seems to be the equivalent of constantly undoing the stitches on a major wound and probing around until it bleeds again. Of course it's none of my business - As MillieMay pointed out I am blessed never to have lost a child ... Nevertheless I have close friends and family members who have and I have supported two of those friends through multiple 2nd trimester losses. My worry is that, long term, support groups and events can become a way of life that keeps some people almost caught in the endless black hole of new grief... and that affects people I care about deeply. I agree with this. I am a mum of 2. Early miscarriage is very very common and in my view something a woman needs to try and prepare for. Of course this will bring major disappointment still that the desire to be a mum remains unfulfilled. I think women need to be informed of the statistics, encouraged to share emotions and be supported but at the same time I definitely dont think it is healthy to encourage women to dwell on a loss of a potential person that never got beyond a few cells (stillbirth is something I view very differently). Life is short and we need to move on. People in some parts of the world lose children all the time to disease, malnutrition etc which is a tragic reality. The loss of unborn children is simply part of the reproduction process, unpleasant as it is, and is not tragedy on the same scale. In fact, in the days when women had bigger families most women would have experienced a miscarriage. That said, I would feel sympathy for women suffering repeat miscarriages as I can appreciate that must be soul destroying. Some women may also be hit especially hard by miscarriage but this could be a sign of other underlying issues eg depression. These women need help to get over their loss and if necessary counselling. However encouraging women to start to wallow in grief does seem unhealthy and imho could be said to be symptomatic of a society where we are becoming self absorbed in many ways. Again, you appear to be missing the point of the article. The purpose of the ceremonies is to allow parents to publicly recognise their grief and, in turn, hopefully move on. To respond to a story about a couple who have experienced monumental heartbreak and tried to turn their grief into something positive, with a sniffy 'it's unhealthy and self-absorbed to wallow' is mean-spirited and offensive. Nassyparks and littlemissmolly, you seem to be completely missing the point here! These services are clearly to help people grieve and then hopefully move forward, to stop them being stuck in grief, which is what you both seem to be criticising. Can I suggest that a few people on this forum seem to be using this opportunity to attack those in pain, surely there is a more appropriate place to do this if that is what you like to do, than underneath these peoples heartwearming story. My suggestion is lets allow people to grieve in whatever way they want to, this world often throws people a lot of pain and if people find a way of getting through it, (like by chatting on forums and using odd terms and names), how about we just support them doing it, rather than throwing further stones at them. I know I personally didnt find comfort in forums and never called my children, rainbow babies, which is one phrase I have heard, but what I did want was a birth certificate for my child and I wanted a funerel or service to prove they were a person, after which I knew I would be able to lay them to rest, just like I did when my Grandparents passed away. The problem with losing a baby that never arrives is people just act like they never existed which further intensfiys the pain, as you eaither feel your fighting a battle to make them be recognized, or you just follow suit and act like they never where here. I must also comment on Nassyparks comment that a miscarriage is just a group of cells, maybe to you it is or was, but not to hundreds of thousands of women in the UK. As soon as we find out we are pregnant, thats our baby, not just a feotus or cells, and whilst I agree that miscarriage is far too common place, so sadly people will often endure a miscarriage in thier life time (if they are lucky enough to be able to have children at all), that doesnt mean people cant grieve or say goodbye to the child they have lost. I know at least 30 people who have lost children, none of which are depressed or sad, but all cary the common thread that they want to mourn their babies in the hope that they can get closure. So please, please , please before anyone else joins this debate think about the people who will read your messages who lost a baby or babies last year, and the year before, and the year before that. Lets respect everyone for where they are, and if you cant say something nice, how about saying nothing at all? To all those here who have lost a baby my heart breaks for you, and I hope in time you will find your peace, and as you hold the memory of your child in your heart, know that not all people feel like the odd few on this forum, we do care and we hear your pain. I totally agree with salomemaloney and Tommyzoom3. Congratulations to the Guardian for including such a heart breaking and touching story. To see this couple turning so much sadness into such an amazing project is inspiring. Its also wonderful to see them with their two lovely daughters, it gives me (and many other I'm sure) hope that you can move through grief and smile again. I know Saying Goodbye will help me and many friends get the chance to say goodbye to our little ones, as if they can do it after 5 losses, I hope I can do it too. To the paper and the media - please show us more stories like this, they give us hope and shine a light onto an often hidden pain. I had a miscarriage after having two healthy babies. It was sad but I was philosophical about it. I looked at my two beautiful children, figured if that's all I ever had I was incredibly happy, and I did move on quite quickly. I almost felt guilty for not being devastated. I went on to have another healthy child followed by another miscarriage. What was harder about the second miscarriage was that only myself and my partner felt sad about it..everyone else seemed to think it was for the best, I had three young children anyway. Our families never really mentioned it, the hospital dealt medically but not emotionally with me. I had a young child in a pushchair, I guess they figured I would be relieved. What I am saying is we need to let the bereaved parents lead the way as to how they feel. They don't have to be devastated but they can be... Perhaps my point has been missed too. I am not saying women should not grieve but also women must be informed on the high chance of problems during very early pregnancy ie first 12 weeks. Nature is very cruel. When I had my first pregnancy I did think I might have miscarried at one stage and of course I would have been sad but I prepared for it. I literally took miscarriage as a default in my situation. To have 5 miscarriages is particularly heartbreaking though and stillbirths must be horrific to endure. Of course for these women suffering this types of loss there need to be all the support possible. Stillbirth rates need to come down too as in this country they are too high. As for the \"cells\" comment, i accept in hindsight this is highly emotive and opens up the whole anti and pro choice debate. Apologies again if I offended as perhaps my wording was unfortunate here. Can I just say as someone who knows a lot about miscarriage and the effects of it on the family (I work along side many organisations and medical bodies who are experts in this field), there are NO links at all of people who suffer with depression being any more likely to misccary then anyone else. However it has been found that if people dont deal with grief (from any source), they may be more likely to miscarry on further occasions, which is why all therapists encourage the grieving process to be fully addressed, as the consequences can be far reaching. 9/10 no reason will be found for the reason a person miscarries, thats why its so often terrible to deal with, as if there is a reason, it can feel preventable in the future. Well done Saying Goodbye for working along side all the charities and professionals working in this arena. Can I also add that the Miscarriage Association do sterling work, so well done to them for supporting such a worthwhile mission. No, your 'point' was not lost on me. Just believe me when I say, that you can never understand the pain of a miscarriage if you have not experienced it yourself. When my partner became we pregnant, we also read all the statistics and tried to 'prepare' ourselves for the worst. We knew that one in four pregnancies ended in miscarriage. However, there is nothing you can do, in advance, to cushion the blow when it actually happens. And to be told by someone that they reckon they know how to do so, because they once thought they may have, is, again, offensive. Like Tommyzoom3 says, if you can't say something nice, then please don't say anything at all. There are some of us, who, for religious reasons to not ascribe to the unborn having names, souls or personhood. What I lost was a potential, not an actual child and I don't feel the need to memorialise or remember. I understand others feel differently, but, to me, it wasn't a life changing event, merely something a bit sad. Miscarriage is not universally devastating, and not being devastated doesn't make you a bad person or a bad parent. That needs to be said too. I have to disagree. I think giving the miscarried baby a name, talking about it, having a photograph taken (if possible and if wished), all these help the parents move through grief. There might be a lot of pain in the early days, and it can be raw, but do you think the pain is any less if the person feels they have to keep it all to themselves ? I have a relation who gave birth to a stillborn daughter in the early 60s. The midwife turned to the husband in front of his wife and just said \"Go home and get her pregnant again as soon as you can and she'll forget soon enough.\" My relation got no chance to see her dead daughter, no chance to say goodbye or give her a name, and has no idea where she is buried. She \"moved on\" because she had to. But this is still very painful to her. And I've heard similar stories. I expect a good number of those parents (and especially the mothers) who were so treated had lots of problems with depression later, whether diagnosed or not. Depression is often the result of repressed mourning for some loss (not necessarily a death.) To mention a deceased child to other children is both healthy and necessary. As Zoe says in the article, those miscarried babies are a part of her. Of course the miscarried babies mustn't be allowed to get in the way of nurturing the born daughters but frankly, if she and her husband hadn't grieved for them properly, and acknowledged their loss, that could lead to all sorts of problems. Bi-weekly trips to the cemetery do sound over-the-top but maybe they are answering a need which will diminish with time. I have to disagree. I think giving the miscarried baby a name, talking about it, having a photograph taken (if possible and if wished), all these help the parents move through grief. There might be a lot of pain in the early days, and it can be raw, but do you think the pain is any less if the person feels they have to keep it all to themselves ? I think you misunderstand me ... I have absolutely no problem whatsoever with bereaved parents doing any of the above and more and I DO strongly believe that for the vast majority it is infinitely more healthy to do so as it gives a focus for their grief rather than internalising the pain. What I was trying to say - obviously unsuccessfully - is that there is an entire grief culture growing up around miscarriages whereby SOME people, initially seeking relief from their pain by talking to others and honouring their lost child, get caught up in the cycle of grief to the exclusion of all else for years. For those people I believe that the peer support group culture can ultimately do more harm than good. I certainly did not mean to come across as disparaging the loss of a child as trivial or that it should be dismissed - merely to question whether the current 'accepted norm' is necessarily as healthy as people believe and whether they might be a better way to help people through their grief. Personally I believe that all GP's and hospitals should offer all women/couples who have experienced a loss professional counselling from as soon after the loss as possible. Peer support groups are amazing but they can become pernicious as vulnerable women seek the company of other vulnerable women to the exclusion of all others and then find themselves endlessly caught up in both their own pain and the pain of others. In short it can become a vicious circle and sometimes it takes an observer on the periphery to recognise that there could be a better way to help people. I agree somewhat with your last point littlemissmolly. When my son died I took great comfort with posting on a bereavement thread, saying his name and talking about him. I posted very intensely for a couple of days and then just read, occassionally posting something for a few weeks. What I noticed is that the regular posters were doing what I can only describe as lacklustre grieving. I don't doubt their terrible grief, but I don't feel that thread was helpful. Real life is out there. We would like another baby and I do feel to some extent this will help us greatly. I fear, however, that we will never have one. That is hard. I confess to feeling a little cross at those who have 2/3 kids and cry endlessly over an early miscarriage. It's sad yes, but look at what you have. Whilst I, and probably many others appreciate you taking the time to admit you had put your previous statement wrongly, I cant help but think you chose the wrong arena to raise your feelings about peer support groups. It must have been immensely difficult for Zoe to open up about there families personal story, and when they have turned such heartache into something so admirable, to dissect your personal opinions of how people handle grief is totally inappropriate. At no point did the article discuss anything other than holding a service to say goodbye, and you have now admitted you agree this should be done......so why say anything negative in the first place? As you haven't ever experienced a personal loss I suggest in future you keep hurtful remarks to yourself, as your words have obviously hurt a lot of people in this forum and that's terrible. I personally agree that people can get stuck in grief....and obviously Zoe and Andy agree with this too, which is why following coming through so much grief themselves, having not just lost one baby but five, they are now trying to help others move forward, in the hope that others may be able to have as positive a life as they now have. I really hope you never personally feel a loss like I, and so many other people have had, but when you say you know what its like because you have seen friends/family go through losses, believe me, you will NEVER know what its like unless it happens to you, and does it matter if you feel forums don't help people....how would you know, you aren't one of them! And to KittyKatdoc. I perfectly respect your feelings, of course everyone feels different about their loss, and if you feel this way that's fantastic for you, these services are only for people who did / do recognise their loss as a baby and want to say good bye to he/she. I hope to all the people reading this that have lost babies, that Zoe and Andy's story gives you hope, and you will come to know that though you will never forget your babies, you can also have a wonderful life and still hold them in your hearts. So to everyone who has lost a baby (and is still heart-broken), do what you need to do, without judgment from others, and we hope there will be more smiles in your day today than tears. As you haven't ever experienced a personal loss I suggest in future you keep hurtful remarks to yourself, as your words have obviously hurt a lot of people in this forum and that's terrible. I'm sorry? I've experienced a great number of personal losses over the years - or are you suggesting that my losses don't count as much as yours? If so then you are admirably demonstrating the 'hierarchy of grief' which I referred to in a previous post. Might I also point out that this is NOT a loss forum in any way - it is a national newspaper where comments are invited on a range of articles from all readers who choose to respond. There is a community policy to show politeness and refrain from personally abusing other posters but nowhere in the Community Guidelines does it state that commentors have to agree with either the content of the article or other commentors - it's called debate. You say \"an entire grief culture\". . .but these sorts of griefs have always been with us. I very much tend to the feeling that people need to grieve and it is better by far if they can do so openly. Not everyone will find a support group helpful, but clearly many do. Not everyone will want to have their baby's photograph framed, but some will. Given how so many hospitals and doctors seem blase if not crassly insensitive to miscarriage (I've not had that upsetting experience myself, but I know others who have), I wouldn't necessarily trust professional counsellors with this. Yes, some are excellent. . .and some are not. Do we really want a society where every loss, every grief has to be referred to a professional ? Your phrase about getting \"caught up in the cycle of grief to the exclusion of all else for years\" I find very problematic. In my own family history (2 generations ago) a child died. (Not a miscarriage, but that's not the point I am making.) The parents were understandably devastated. They blamed themselves as so many grieving people do, though in truth the little boy's death was no-one's fault. They had one child at the same of this death, and they subsequently had another. And the name of the little boy who died was hardly ever mentioned again. His toys were hidden away in the attic, never looked at, photographs of him were stored away and never looked at. Needless to say, there were no support groups then, no counselling. That grief did go on for years, bubbling beneath the surface of every day life, eating away at people. The Elephant in the Room. It was destructive. And was never resolved. They got STUCK in the cycle of grief because the surrounding culture believed in \"stiff upper lip\" and \"getting on with things\". Grief is part of life. It does no good to pretend it is not there. I would have thought in these support groups (as in others, for other problems) there are some people who are further along the path. Their presence and their insights can be of help to the people still very, very distressed. I was clearly referring to the fact you haven't experienced a loss of a baby, which is very different to other losses, (Note I am not saying worse, just different). Your creation of the term 'hierarchy of grief', would suggest one persons pain is greater than another, which simply shows a lack of understanding of parental loss. Every single person grieves differently, and no way is wrong, all I asked is that you refrain from telling those who get the support they need from forums or the like, that they are wrong for doing so, as that is simply wrong. I do feel you have breached the guidelines, as your comments are offensive to many, incl to me. This is also not a debate forum, or a loss forum, its purely a place to comment amount an article that was sensitively written, so perhaps you should join a grief 'debate' elsewhere, and refrain from telling people how 'you feel' they should grieve. Well done to these people for doing this, I'm sure for some parents and families it is incredibly helpful at a terrible time. I can't imagine having five losses, how sad for this family. The comments on this forum are interesting....just as everyone is entitled to their own style of grieving, everyone is also entitled to their own opinion on emotive subjects. I have just miscarried my first child, it happened at 8 weeks on April 3. For me the best thing to do is just get on with day to day life, not think about it too much and try to conceive another child as soon as possible. It sounds incredibly harsh (and I am sure this will attract much comment...) but the best way for me to deal with it is not to think of it as a child with a name, hair colour, personality but as an embryo with no discernible features and no brain function. I appreciate that for a still birth this is probably a different scenario however for early miscarriage I do think too much \"remembrance\" could potentially be damaging. It would be for me anyway. I am not religious, maybe I would feel differently if I was. Miscarriage however does cause a loss of innocence in pregnancy....next time I see those two pink lines I'll just see it as step one of a very complicated process that may not end in a bundle of joy. Sad but true ......and realistic. People who are struggling with this have my sincere sympathy. I do also think that there is a lot of wisdom in littlemissmolly's comment. She clearly has experience dealing with other people's grief in her profession, and dismissing what she is saying is doing exactly what she is being accused of - not understanding other people's way of grieving. Great that there is support for people who find this genuinely helpful, but it is not disrespectful to voice concern for those who turn such forums etc into a crutch, or seek out ways to keep old wounds open. Something I really dislike about comment threads touching on children/parenthood is the number of posters who deride others for having differing opinions. I am inclined to agre with LittleMissMolly. Of course parents should have support dealing with their grief for a miscarried child, but I think the current trend in these matters often leads to people carrying the grief around, raw, for a longer time than is necessary. Something I really dislike about comment threads touching on children/parenthood is the number of posters who deride others for having differing opinions, especailyl if they haven't experienced the issue. I am inclined to agre with LittleMissMolly. Of course parents should have support dealing with their grief for a miscarried child, but I think the current trend in these matters often leads to people carrying the grief around, raw, for a longer time than is necessary, with the grieving period lasting much longer than for any other family member. An ex-colleague of mine had a stillborn baby. About two months later she started deluging Facebook with statuses relating to stillbirth, and four years later still does so and it's clear that much of her social life revolves around support groups, etc. Conversely, I have a close friend who desperately wants a second child and has miscarried three times. It's devastating each time, but she manages to grieve and move on, and enjoy life with her husband and son while still hoping for another baby. Also, spare a thought for the poor kids growing up as the son or daughter of a mother of two who \"thinks of herself as a mother of seven.\" I know a couple of people who have had to grow up in the shadow of siblings who died before they were born and it has a marked psychological effect. As a counsellor, I can assure you being brought up by a mother who has clearly grieved for her five losses, and has now turned her experience into a wonderful organisation, would have no negative effects on any living children. The only problem is when people don't grieve. What message would it say to a child, if a lost baby was just forgotten and never mentioned....! Surely that children don't matter. That said this has nothing to do with the article, this has now turned into a mass of peoples opinions, most of which seem to be coming from people who have never even lost children, but seem to be experts in telling others how to grieve the loss of a child. There is clearly no right way or wrong way to deal with grief, everyone's story is different, but the common factor is pain. Can I re-state what TommyZoom said, if you cant say something nice, how about saying nothing at all. The 'Saying Goodbye' initiative is a very touching idea. We lost our baby at 14 weeks' gestation and had a previous miscarriage at seven weeks. The cathedral services they are organising will, I am sure, be highly cathartic and helpful. We will definitely go to one. Thank you so much. Why do you think they are \"carrying the grief around, raw, for a longer time than is necessary\"? What makes you think that? If it's because they are still very sad about it at some point when you have decided they shouldn't be, stop and consider that perhaps they are not still upset because they are rubbish at grieving - and need your tips on how to be bereaved better - but because their baby died . You are comparing two different people. It sounds like the ex-colleague is dealing with grief in one way, and your friend in another way. Neither way is wrong. But you sound uncomfortable (and frankly,disapproving) of the ex-colleague's way. \"Longer than is necessary ?\" How long is necessary ? How can anyone possibly decide ? I think the two lovely little girls pictured above will know how much they are loved and wanted. If dubious remarks are being made (\"Oh, the babies I lost would have been much nicer than you\") then of course that would be damaging. Simply acknowledging that there were other lives diminishes nobody. Prior to having a miscarriage I, like you, underestimated the gravity of losing an unborn baby. Even when I first miscarried I thought, yes this hurts but I will get over it soon. Then the grief came. Yes, I have moved on and I get on with and enjoy my life, but I live with the loss of my baby like I live with having lost other people I have loved. Really the main question I would like to ask you is: where do you draw the line between miscarriage and still birth? The point at which I had to be induced to deliver my baby, it would have been considered a 'still birth' had I been in the american medical system. In britain it was termed a 'late miscarriage'. I find it difficult to understand how a weeks difference in the age of a baby could make a difference to the level of grief it's parents will feel. I think every parent to be has the right to grieve for their unborn baby (no matter how many weeks or months old the baby is) in any way that helps them and I think it 's great that people are helping parents to be able to do this.

            "      1 Zlatan Ibrahimovic's four goals stole the limelight from England centurion Steven Gerrard, who described the Sweden striker's performance as 'world class'. The Paris St Germain striker led his side to a 4-2 victory over Roy Hodgson's outfit at the newly opened Friends Stadium in Stockholm. The fourth was a particular highlight, a bicycle kick from outside the area after goalkeeper Joe Hart failed to clear. Main man: Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored all four goals against England It was the first time England had tasted defeat under Hodgson in 90 minutes and Gerrard was full of praise for the game's main protagonist. ' I still stick by Zinedine Zidane, he is the best player in the world as the best player of his generation, but his (Ibrahimovic's) performance was world class and he just scored one of the best goals I seen live,' Gerrard told ITV1. ' It was his night. If someone scores four goals and the way he scored them....it's one of the best I've seen. !00 not out: Steven Gerrard became the six England centurion against Sweden ' There were a lot of positives from our point of view, a lot of young players playing their first games and we can take a lot from this game.' England seemed to have the game under control when they were 2-1 ahead thanks to goals from debutant Steven Caulker and second-half substitute Danny Welbeck, but a host of changes allowed the hosts to get back into the game. ' When you make more than three substitutions it does spoil the game,' Gerrard said. Plenty to ponder: Roy Hodgson suffered his first defeat in normal time ' The manager is under pressure from other managers and he is respecting those mangers because those players are playing in Europe and it does upset the rhythm. ' We were comfortable until we made changes.' Asked about making his 100th appearance, Gerrard added: 'This is a special shirt for me. I'll give this to my dad and it will be a nice present for him.' Hodgson acknowledged Ibrahimovic's performance but felt more could have been done to prevent him completing such a haul. Hat-trick: Ibrahimovic scored his third with a free kick from outside the box ' The fourth goal was extraordinary, but it was the second and third goals which cost us,' he said. 'For 70 minutes we were playing very well and we deserved to be in the lead, but we made changes and they took the initiative. Your comments: Despite that he scored 4 goals, I'd like to see him do that in the premier league. Ibrahimovic is way too overrated hence why he keeps moving clubs as they see how average he is. Suarez once scored 4 goals for Uraguay and is 10x better than Ibra. \n",
            "      1 Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored four times in Stockholm to give Sweden a memorable win over England at their new national stadium. Roy Hodgson gave international debuts to Raheem Sterling, Steven Caulker and Leon Osman from the start while Steven Gerrard captained the side on the night of his 100th international cap. A quiet opening period ended when the Swedish striker got his first on 19 minutes. The forward prodded home after a counter-attack which saw England punished for giving the ball away too easy. England fought back and Tom Cleverley was unlucky not to have drawn level when he prodded wide from close range and two quick-fire goals put Hodgson's side ahead at half-time. On 35 minutes, Ashley Young beat his man on the left and his cross into the area was put home by Danny Welbeck from close range. Only three minutes later, Gerrard put in a free-kick that the debutant Caulker slotted home at the far post. The game ebbed and flowed throughout the second half as both sides enjoyed chances to add further goals, before Ibrahimovic stepped up and stole the show. He got his second on 77 minutes, taking a lofted pass from Anders Svensson on his chest before volleying it past Joe Hart. And then seven minutes later Ibrahimovic completed his hat-trick when he drilled a low free kick in from long range. In injury time Ibrahimovic put the cherry on the cake with an incredible goal. When Hart raced out of his area he couldn't head it far enough away, and the Swedish striker hit an acrobatic over-head kick from at least 30 yards out that landed in the unguarded net. \n"

Harlem Renaissance After the American civil war, liberated African-Americans searched for a safe place to explore their new identities as free men and women. They found it in Harlem. Read on to find out how this New York neighborhood became home to some of the best and brightest minds of the 20th century, gave birth to a cultural revolution, and earned its status as \"the capital of black America.\" The Great Migration The end of the American Civil War in 1865 ushered in an era of increased education and employment opportunities for black Americans. This created the first black middle class in America, and its members began expecting the same lifestyle afforded to white Americans. But in 1896, racial equality was delivered a crushing blow when the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court case declared racial segregation to be constitutionally acceptable. This created even harsher conditions for African-Americans, particularly in some Southern states that sought to minimize the equality that former slaves and their descendants might aspire toward. The South also became gradually more and more economically depressed as boll weevils began to infest cotton crops. This reduced the amount of labor needed in the South. As a result, blacks began to head to the Northern United States by the millions. Racism, while still a serious obstacle, was considered much less brutal there than in the South. In addition, the North granted all adult men with the right to vote; provided better educational advancement for African-Americans and their children; and offered greater job opportunities as a result of World War I and the industrial revolution. This phenomenon, known as the Great Migration, brought more than seven million African-Americans to the North. Harlem: The Black Mecca Housing executives planned to create neighborhoods in Harlem designed specifically for white workers who wanted to commute into the city. Developers grew overambitious, however, and housing grew more rapidly than the transportation necessary to bring residents into the downtown area. The once exclusive district was abandoned by the white middle-class, and frustrated developers were forced to cope with lower purchase prices than they first anticipated. White Harlem landlords started selling their properties to black real estate agents such as Philip A. Payton, John E. Nail, and Henry C. Parker. They also began renting directly to black tenants. Meanwhile, the re-development and gentrification of midtown pushed many blacks out of the Metropolitan area. As a result, African-Americans began moving to Harlem en masse; between 1900 and 1920 the number of blacks in the New York City neighborhood doubled. By the time the planned subway system and roadways reached Harlem, many of the country's best and brightest black advocates, artists, entrepreneurs, and intellectuals had situated themselves in Harlem. They brought with them not only the institutions and businesses necessary to support themselves, but a vast array of talents and ambitions. The area soon became known as \"the Black Mecca\" and \"the capital of black America.\" The Harlem Renaissance During the early 1900s, the burgeoning African-American middle class began pushing a new political agenda that advocated racial equality. The epicenter of this movement was in New York, where three of the largest civil rights groups established their headquarters. Black historian, sociologist, and Harvard scholar, W. E. B. Du Bois was at the forefront of the civil rights movement at this time. In 1905 Du Bois, in collaboration with a group of prominent African-American political activists and white civil rights workers, met in New York to discuss the challenges facing the black community. In 1909, the group founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), to promote civil rights and fight African-American disenfranchisement. At this same time, the Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey began his promotion of the \"Back to Africa movement.\" Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL), which advocated the reuniting of all people of African ancestry into one community with one absolute government. The movement not only encouraged African-Americans to come together, but to also feel pride in their heritage and race. The National Urban League (NUL) also came into being in the early 20th century. Founded by Ruth Standish Baldwin and Dr. George Edmund Haynes, the fledgling organization counseled black migrants from the South, trained black social workers, and worked to give educational and employment opportunities to blacks. Together, these groups helped to establish a sense of community and empowerment for African-Americans not only in New York, but also around the country. In addition, they provided a rare opportunity for whites to collaborate with black intellectuals, social activists, educators, and artists in an attempt to transform a largely segregated and racist American society. Instead of using more direct political means to achieve their goals, African-American civil rights activists employed the artists and writers of their culture to work for the goals of civil rights and equality. Jazz music, African-American fine art, and black literature were all absorbed into mainstream culture, bringing attention to a previously disenfranchised segment of the American population. This blossoming of African-American culture in European-American society, particularly in the worlds of art and music, became known as The Harlem Renaissance. Culture Comes Together One of the first notable events of the Renaissance came shortly after the NUL began publishing Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life. Believing that art and literature could lift African-Americans out of their situation, the magazine's editor, Charles S. Johnson, began printing promising black writers in each issue. During Johnson's work for Opportunity, he met Jessie Fauset , the literary editor for Du Bois' NAACP magazine, Crisis. Fauset told Johnson about her first novel, There Is Confusion (1924), a story about middle class black women. In 1924, Johnson organized the first Civic Club dinner, which was planned as a release party for Fauset's book. The party was an instant success, and served as a forum for emerging African-American artists to meet wealthy white patrons. The party managed to launch the careers of several promising black writers, including poets Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen . In 1925, shortly after the success of the Civic Club dinner, the magazine Survey Graphic, produced an issue on Harlem. Edited by black philosopher and Howard University professor, Alain Locke , the magazine featured work by prominent black writers of the time period. The magazine published work by writers Cullen, Hughes and Fauset, as well as poet Claude McKay and novelist Jean Toomer . Later that year, Locke expanded the special issue into an anthology called The New Negro. The collection fueled America's growing interest in African-American writers, pushing black artists to the literary forefront. African-American fine artists such as Aaron Douglas and Charles Alston also got their start through Alain Locke and Charles Johnson, who started publishing the artists' works as illustrations and cover art. Pulled into the spotlight, these fine artists used their fame as an opportunity to delve into the themes they found problematic to American culture. By introducing the \"exoticizing\" of Africa and notions of \"the primitive\" to white America, African-American artists had their first opportunity to explore how these ideas could be used for and against their race. The Jazz Age With the conclusion of WWI came an end to wartime frugality and conservation. In an era of peace, Americans experienced an economic boom, as well as a change in social morays. Nicknamed \"The Roaring 20s\" for its dynamic changes, the decade became known for its celebration of excess and its rejection of wartime ideologies. Americans also began investing more time and money in leisure activities and artistic endeavors. Around this same time, Congress ratified the Prohibition Act. While the amendment did not ban the actual consumption of alcohol, it made obtaining it legally difficult. Liquor-serving nightclubs, called \"speakeasies\" developed during this time as a way to allow Americans to socialize, indulge in alcohol consumption, and rebel against the traditional culture. One of the best speakeasies in Harlem was the Cotton Club, a place that intended to have the look and feel of a luxurious Southern plantation. To complete the theme, only African-American entertainers could perform there, while only white clientele (with few exceptions) were allowed to patronize the establishment. This attracted high-powered celebrity visitors such as Cole Porter , Bing Crosby and Doris Duke to see the most talented black entertainers of the day. Some of the most famous jazz performers of the time - including singer Lena Horne , composer and musician Duke Ellington , and singer Cab Calloway - graced the Cotton Club stage. Attending clubs in Harlem allowed whites from New York and its surrounding areas to indulge in two taboos simultaneously: to drink, as well as mingle with blacks. Jazz musicians often performed in these clubs, exposing white clientele to what was typically an African-American form of musical entertainment. As jazz hit the mainstream, many members of older generations began associating the raucous behavior of young people of the decade with jazz music. They started referring to the 20s, along with its new dance styles and racy fashions, as \"The Jazz Age.\" The End of the Renaissance As the 20s came to a close, so did white America's infatuation with Harlem- and the artistic and intellectual movements surrounding it. The advent of The Great Depression also crushed the wild enthusiasm of \"The Roaring 20s,\" bringing an end to the decadence and indulgence that fueled the patronage of Harlem artists and their establishments. The depression hit the African-American segment of the population hard; layoffs and housing foreclosures shut many blacks out of the American Dream that previously seemed so close at hand. The increased economic tension of the Depression caused black leaders to shift their focus from arts and culture to the financial and social issues of the time. In addition, the strained relationship between the black community and the white shop-owners in Harlem finally tore the two groups apart in 1935. That alienation was expressed in the Harlem Riot of 1935, the nation's first modem race riot. The resulting violence finally shattered the notion of Harlem as the \"Mecca\" for African-Americans, and broke the fleeting truce between white and black America. While the Renaissance as a historical movement was over, the effects it had on modern society were far from finished. The artistic and political movements of the 20s would live on in American culture in the form of new musical expression, award-winning writing and, most importantly, the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s. These events, and the role Harlem would continue to play after the Renaissance, would change the American cultural landscape forever. \n",
            "$6000 Bulletproof Attach Keeps Documents Safer Than They Need To Be Let's say you've got some really important documents -- like the meaning of life scrawled on a napkin, or a viable method of time travel in the margins of a newspaper -- and someone really wants to shoot them for some reason with a gun. You had better hope those documents are in the Tegra-Lite Bulletproof Attach. Pretty much everything about the case is over the top. Its body is made out of 65 layers of a polypropylene thermoplastic composite, it costs a whopping $US5995, and only 28 are being made. At least someone realised the demand probably won't be too high. As you might expect from an attach that caters to the spy-minded, it also has a false bottom and a handcuff ring. It also has a spot for your iPad, and it weighs 5.4kg so you can use it to fend off melee attackers. The best defence against bullets is to not be shot at in the first place, but a bulletproof attach might be a close second. Gotta keep all your precious crayon doodlings safe somehow, right?

There's no pushing and no uncomfortable feeling when in the shop. I have 3 more tats in mind and I wouldn't go anywhere else. Review from Lauren D. This business should be shut down.The customer service is terrible and they stole $400 from me. I had a large tattoo that I was going to do in 2 session. I started it in March of 2008 and circumstances prevented me from coming back until recently. Also,I was leary of going back to get it finished because it healed terribly. When I called to tell them that they would have to touch it up, Robert blamed me for not healing it properly,even though I have 5 other tattoos that all healed fine. When I called in Feb to schedule the final session, Robert claimed that the work they already did was $600 worth of tattooing. LIES! So I went in with my friend who is a tattoo artist, he and immediatlely insulted her and told me to leave. I have since been calling at least once a week and he keeps screwing me over by telling me I have to talk to the artist, then never putting the artist on the phone. I finally got ahold of the artist, and he claims the same thing...the he never told me he would do the tattoo in 2 sessions, and the work he did was it. He continued to be a jerk to me on the phone, so I called him a liar and hung up. \n",

            "012?This is a case series of six patients who presented with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The aim is to understand these clinicoradiological features of PRES and its management Abstract These are case series with six patients who presented with Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome related to severe hypertension due to various causes managed by neurology team based in DGH & Tertiary neurosciences centre. This series shows the diversity of its presentation and quick recognisation and management would help in reversing the damage but there are situation were controlling hypertension becomes difficult due to nature of the aetiology of the hypertension as a result this could lead to non reversible damages. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome also called as PRES is a clinico radiological syndrome with severe hypertension, altered sensorium, seizures, visual symptoms and MRI features of changes involving predominantly the occipitopareital areas, cerebellum, BS. Prompt treatment with antihypertensive to bring down the blood pressure had been effective in reversing the damage. Understanding the tolerability and the safe practice in management of hypertension and possible adverse effects due to difficulties in controlling blood pressure with various comorbidity is very important. At present commonly used protocols are Labetalol or Glyceryl tri nitrate infusion and maintenance with single or combination therapy. Most of the critical care physicians worldwide favour labetalol and sodium nitroprusside with caution. What ever antihypertensive agents we use the evidences suggest to concentrate in bringing mean arterial pressure down by 25% in first 2 -- 4?h is a reasonably approach. PRES is otherwise a neurological emergency which can present as severe head ache, status epilepticus, posterior circulation infarct, acute visual loss? cause with severe hypertension. \n",
            "017 The Time Meddler And so it begins. Gallifrey begins to emerge into the Doctor Who mythos, ready to take it's grand place alongside other significant Who staples. At last the noble race of Time Lords can stand revealed as we learn just where the Doctor came from. Except we don't. Don't worry, we will. Gallifrey, as Rassilon proclaimed not long ago, will rise. But The Time Meddler is more akin to a sneak peek and the Monk a rather less than sterling example of Gallifrey's finest. But I'm getting ahead of myself. We open on a rather sinister looking clock ticking away. It's obviously an attempt at foreshadowing, but it just doesn't quite work for me. It puts me more in mind of the opening of Back to the Future. What is effective is the shot of the Doctor standing over the TARDIS controls as if he's just left Bad Wolf Bay, even without knowing what has gone before you can tell just looking at William Hartnell that he's suffered some kind of loss. Vicki is kind enough to bring us up to speed by discussing the recent departure of Ian and Barbara. It's quite easy to dismiss the importance of this event nearly half a century later, but their departure left Hartnell as the only remaining cast member from the opening episode. In a moment that sadly doesn't seem to have set a precedent the Doctor freely admits to being saddened by their departure. This isn't yet the gallivanting alien who picks up and deposits passengers like a interdimensional taxi driver, this is a man who is hurt enough by his abandonment to let it show and it's quite disconcerting. \"We may land in their time one day and be able to discuss old times.\" We know they won't. Even once the Doctor finally learns to fly the TARDIS we know that he seldom revisits old friendships outside of Sarah Jane and the Brig, but it leaves the door open nicely for Ian and Barbara to return and for the audience to not feel they're gone forever. As luck would have it just as Vicki and the Doctor are bemoaning their lack of company they hear what they presume to be a Dalek wondering round the TARDIS. It turns out instead to be Steven Taylor, played by Peter Purves  (yes him from Crufts) rather than Jack Davenport. Whist Steven recovers with his cuddly panda (I'm not joking) the TARDIS materialises on a beach, observed by a lone monk.  He seems intrigued about the TARDIS, but not overly shocked. Almost as if he knows more than he should. The first time I saw The Time Meddler I was genuinely intrigued about the monk, after all the Internet had yet to spoil most of the series for me. I'd imagine that most of you reading this review know fine well that the monk is in fact a Time Lord? No? Ah. Spoilers. Should have said. In the TARDIS Steven is being given a guided tour of his new home. The highlights for me include the horizontal control and \"a chair with a panda on it.\" The tour concludes with the Doctor making a request of the new companion: \"Please stop buggering me.\" Meanwhile, back in the TARDIS Steven is being given a guided tour of his new home. The highlights for me include the horizontal control and \"a chair with a panda on it.\" The tour concludes with the Doctor making a request of the new companion. \"Please stop buggering me.\" It's safe to presume from Vicki's face that this wasn't the intended line, however I can state with absolute certainty that whatever was initially scripted wasn't nearly as amusing. Steven's disbelief is somewhat refreshing. No polite disbelief or incredulous looks for him. As far as he's concerned this old man is off his rocker, but he takes it in good humour and continues to gently mock the Doctor for the rest of the episode. Indeed his mock interrogation of the Doctor's story leads to details of the craft being given within ear shot of the Monk's hearing. It's at this point I had to remind myself that this was made in the 60s. It's early days for the show's mythos and there is absolutely no reason that the Doctor should be able to sense the Monk just because he could sense the Master in his Tenth body. We're reminded, quite forcibly, that a lot of the show's continuity was cobbled together as it went along and that there was just no way the writers could anticipate their scripts having to conform to rules that wouldn't exist as we know them for decades to come. But I digress. As night falls on our crew it casts an eerie shadow over proceedings, that is until you hear the wildlife sounds cranked up just a little too much. I'm still trying to decide if it was a plot point or not. The night shots are beautifully realised. Just as well really as the sun sets in this serial more times than it would in a Michael Bay film. Still, it looks the part. The Doctor informs the fourth wall that he misses having a History Teacher as a companion. He's not alone, not if it means we're spared such painful conversations. After wandering off from his companions the Doctor tries to casually ascertain the year from a local stopping just short of asking what the year actually is. He later informs the fourth wall that he misses having a History Teacher as a companion. He's not alone, not if it means we're spared such painful conversations. The monks chanting that the Doctor then overhears sounds suspiciously like a bad recording. So much so that when the chanting speed suddenly varies like a tape being chewed it takes me a few moments to realise that it's a plot point rather than a prop failure (although curiously the chanting is revealed as originating on a gramophone player. Possibly high technology at the time of broadcast, being a child of the late 70s I can only guess, but it certainly isn't a tape!) The first episode ends with the Doctor being trapped by the Monk. We'll skip the second episode entirely as it feels very much like filler, probably due to the absence of the Doctor for the duration of it. When we finally catch up with him, the Doctor is casually discussing his escape with a local. Given his later fear and disdain of his fellow Time Lords he seems remarkably unconcerned about the Monk. Continuity tinted glasses again I guess. These same glasses muddy the waters somewhat when it comes to judging the Monk. On one hand he's seen healing the wounded and sick with penicillin, something quite Doctor-like, and then we see him consulting his eight point plan for villainy. Seriously. He has an actual plan on a pull down chart. 'Position Atomic Canon' followed by 'Sight Vikings' gives you an idea of just how well thought out his plan is. But the Monk isn't the highlight of this episode, it's the Doctor himself. The time off seems to have worked wonders for Hartnell and he returns in sparkling form and seems to relish taking on the Monk. A shame then that the Monk fails to live up to any kind of challenge. Having said that, their dialogue in the last episode gives us our first glimpse of where these Time Lords have come from. \"You know as well as I do the golden rule about space and time travelling\" \"Never, never interfere with the course of history.\" \"Who says so?\" Asks the Monk and the thought occurs that his dialogue wouldn't be out of place spoken by the Fourth Doctor and to prove the point he finishes with \"It's more fun my way.\" As the Monk rattles off his list of achievements to date you can't help but agree with him.  Then when he mentions his hand in building Stonehenge you begin to wonder just who it was that built the Pandorica for the Alliance. Continuity Tinted Glasses again and if you watch this episode wearing them then you can't help but be struck by the sheer hypocrisy of the Doctor. Throughout this story the Doctor acts more like the Time Lords he's running from rather than the free spirit he's set to become, but when you consider that he only seems to be fifty years away from Gallifrey according to the Monk then it's really not that surprising he's still holding on to some of the basic tenets that he was raised with. His final solution of trapping the Monk on earth without a functioning TARDIS actually works better with the continuity glasses as it eerily foreshadows the Pertwee era. Speaking of the Monk's TARDIS, it's reveal at the end of Episode 3 must have been truly staggering at it's first showing. No-one knew anything of where the Doctor came from and to discover one of his own kind half way through an historical must have been staggering for the audience of the time. Ultimately The Time Meddler works best for what it implies rather than what it shows. The Monk isn't anything close to a match for the Doctor despite superior equipment and could never be the Master in my mind, regardless of what some fan theories have suggested. However through his dialogue with the Doctor we learn an awful lot about where they came from and just who the Doctor might have been before we met him. And this wouldn't be the last time we met a Time Lord. Indeed, we might even meet this particular Time Lord again... I'll leave you with the highlight for me though; an exchange between Vicki and Steven discussing the implications of meddling with time. \"Memories will change\" we're told. It's an explanation for every continuity error made during the fifty year run given, for all intents and purposes, at the very start of the run. Yet people still get upset when some things don't match up perfectly between episodes. About the author Alasdair Shaw dabbled in Who throughout the 80s, but didn't really get into it properly until 1989. His sense of timing has not improved over the years. He's a third generation Who fan as well as a father of two. His wife has a bad feeling about those two facts. When not working as a lab technician or writing for Kasterborous Alasdair runs the Doctor Who Reprint Society for which he writes In Print and Dangling Threads. He's a big fan of the Valeyard, but that's neither here nor there. He has never worked for UNIT and is not related to Dr Liz Shaw. we were so excited when we saw the inside of the monk's Tardis. It's difficult to explain how magical the Tardis control room was. It was the santuary, the place of safety that could be maddeningly out of reach. That is why the cliff hanger in the Web planet where the Tardis was apparently lost worked so well for us \"...there is absolutely no reason that the Doctor should be able to sense the Monk just because he could sense the Master in his Tenth body\" -- maybe the Dr/other Time Lords can only sense the presence of high-ranking Time Lords; perhaps the Monk just doesn't cut it? Interestingly, the Dr later senses the presence of the presumed-dead Morbius, when he's being drugged via the glass of wine at Solon's castle. I enjoyed reading this, AS, though I think you mean 'basic tenets he was raised with' rather than 'tenants'; but I like the idea of the Monk growing up with flatmates! I remember at the time I first saw this in the early 1990?s on BBC2 thinking the implied rape of Edith was totally unsuitable for a children's programme and totlaly out of the keep of the rest of the story. I still think that, but as Edith seems to get over it very quickly I will too! I was really impressed with the cliffhanger for part three though and Peter Butterworth is really good throughout the story. I loved the Target novelizations of the Hartnell stories in the eighties, but being too young to have watched the stories on TV I had to imagine what those years looked like. (Which was the magic of those books. They made us create our own vision of Doctor Who, and this demand on my imagination got me even more hooked on the show). But until I recently sat down and carefully watched every Hartnell adventure, I hadn't appreciated just how good Peter Purves was. Right from the start, he was a reliable foil for the Doctor, and he gives The Time Meddler a solid, human core. His anger at the end of The Massacre is the most believable dramatic moment of the Hartnell years. I'd have loved to see him hang around longer to be a straight man to Troughton. The Monk could have been the Master, but of course it was never intended. I like to think that the Monk was Hartnell's functional equivalent of the Master. Except like many Doctor Who concepts (such as the Doctor at the time) he was unfinished and very much prototypical, unlike Troughton's War Chief (If you've ever seen the War Games you'll know what i mean). The same 80?s Master that was in the King's Demons you mean? A basic rehash of the same story you just reviewed? C'mon, even the Monk would facepalm the Master's sloppy execution in that story. I can't see why you'd be baffled by the idea that someone would like to use their imagination, so what if someone likes the idea that the Monk was the Master? It's not a crime. I simply expressed both the Monk and the War Chief's functional equivalency to the Master, I could go as far as to say Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty's relationship was functionally similar to the Third Doctor and the Master, as was intended by the production team. Doesn't mean i think they are all the same character. I was going by your opening comment; \"The Monk could of been the Master\". I'm all for linking continuities and histories together, as long as there is some logic and substance presented with the argument. Apart from being Time Lords that the Doctor has fought I can't see a single connection. I've not seen The King's Demons, but a quick glance through a synopsis reveals the Master's plan to be a little more thought out than the Monk's one. That's the beauty of it, a connection or a pattern is always in the eye of the beholder. But from a production point of view, they'll always be seperate characters, unless some future producer decides to highlight the issue. As for King's Demons, well i guess you'll just have to give it a spin. One of the Master's best wigs, and possibly his worst plan yet. Still fun to watch though What is interesting is that at the end of Episode 10 of The Daleks master Plan The Doctor strands The Monk on an ice planet and The Monk's last ever words(if we accept your reasoning) are \"I'll get you for this Doctor! I'll get you one day!\" In \"Terror of the Autons\" (The Master's supposed \"first\" appearance) a Time Lord comes to warn The Doctor that \"an old acquaintance has arrived on this planet\" and that he \"has learnt a great deal since you last met him\". The original script also noted that \"The Master\" was a new alias, and that the Doctor had ruined one of \"The Master\"'s schemes, and that \"The Master\" was out for revenge. The Doctor is unimpressed \"That jackanapes! All hes does is cause trouble!\" he states and later \"I refuse to be worried by a renegade like The Master. He's a, he's an unimaginative plodder.\" It is only when he sees that \"The Master\" has indeed learnt a great deal since they last met that he takes the threat seriously. And we know that when they last met The Master could not have been in his Delgado incarnation when The Doctor fails to recognise the voice on the telephone. Then there's the fact that The Monk was always going on about his \"master plan\". Or the fact that the Time lord specifically states that The Master scored higher marks in science than The Doctor. The Monk was able to fix his faulty chameleon circuit(which The Doctor never did), and escape from 1066 in a TARDIS with a shrunken interior. It makes no sense he would never come after The Doctor again. And where was The Doctor's prior(to Autons) meeting with The Master? The Master of Logopolis is reckless like The Monk. And Doctor Who Magazine ran an article shortly before the aforementioned King's Demons stating that it would feature the return of a villain first seen in The Time Meddler. Quite frankly, the idea that The Monk ISN'T The Master is what I find bizarre. \n",

Harlem Renaissance After the American civil war, liberated African-Americans searched for a safe place to explore their new identities as free men and women. They found it in Harlem. Read on to find out how this New York neighborhood became home to some of the best and brightest minds of the 20th century, gave birth to a cultural revolution, and earned its status as \"the capital of black America.\" The Great Migration The end of the American Civil War in 1865 ushered in an era of increased education and employment opportunities for black Americans. This created the first black middle class in America, and its members began expecting the same lifestyle afforded to white Americans. But in 1896, racial equality was delivered a crushing blow when the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court case declared racial segregation to be constitutionally acceptable. This created even harsher conditions for African-Americans, particularly in some Southern states that sought to minimize the equality that former slaves and their descendants might aspire toward. The South also became gradually more and more economically depressed as boll weevils began to infest cotton crops. This reduced the amount of labor needed in the South. As a result, blacks began to head to the Northern United States by the millions. Racism, while still a serious obstacle, was considered much less brutal there than in the South. In addition, the North granted all adult men with the right to vote; provided better educational advancement for African-Americans and their children; and offered greater job opportunities as a result of World War I and the industrial revolution. This phenomenon, known as the Great Migration, brought more than seven million African-Americans to the North. Harlem: The Black Mecca Housing executives planned to create neighborhoods in Harlem designed specifically for white workers who wanted to commute into the city. Developers grew overambitious, however, and housing grew more rapidly than the transportation necessary to bring residents into the downtown area. The once exclusive district was abandoned by the white middle-class, and frustrated developers were forced to cope with lower purchase prices than they first anticipated. White Harlem landlords started selling their properties to black real estate agents such as Philip A. Payton, John E. Nail, and Henry C. Parker. They also began renting directly to black tenants. Meanwhile, the re-development and gentrification of midtown pushed many blacks out of the Metropolitan area. As a result, African-Americans began moving to Harlem en masse; between 1900 and 1920 the number of blacks in the New York City neighborhood doubled. By the time the planned subway system and roadways reached Harlem, many of the country's best and brightest black advocates, artists, entrepreneurs, and intellectuals had situated themselves in Harlem. They brought with them not only the institutions and businesses necessary to support themselves, but a vast array of talents and ambitions. The area soon became known as \"the Black Mecca\" and \"the capital of black America.\" The Harlem Renaissance During the early 1900s, the burgeoning African-American middle class began pushing a new political agenda that advocated racial equality. The epicenter of this movement was in New York, where three of the largest civil rights groups established their headquarters. Black historian, sociologist, and Harvard scholar, W. E. B. Du Bois was at the forefront of the civil rights movement at this time. In 1905 Du Bois, in collaboration with a group of prominent African-American political activists and white civil rights workers, met in New York to discuss the challenges facing the black community. In 1909, the group founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), to promote civil rights and fight African-American disenfranchisement. At this same time, the Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey began his promotion of the \"Back to Africa movement.\" Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL), which advocated the reuniting of all people of African ancestry into one community with one absolute government. The movement not only encouraged African-Americans to come together, but to also feel pride in their heritage and race. The National Urban League (NUL) also came into being in the early 20th century. Founded by Ruth Standish Baldwin and Dr. George Edmund Haynes, the fledgling organization counseled black migrants from the South, trained black social workers, and worked to give educational and employment opportunities to blacks. Together, these groups helped to establish a sense of community and empowerment for African-Americans not only in New York, but also around the country. In addition, they provided a rare opportunity for whites to collaborate with black intellectuals, social activists, educators, and artists in an attempt to transform a largely segregated and racist American society. Instead of using more direct political means to achieve their goals, African-American civil rights activists employed the artists and writers of their culture to work for the goals of civil rights and equality. Jazz music, African-American fine art, and black literature were all absorbed into mainstream culture, bringing attention to a previously disenfranchised segment of the American population. This blossoming of African-American culture in European-American society, particularly in the worlds of art and music, became known as The Harlem Renaissance. Culture Comes Together One of the first notable events of the Renaissance came shortly after the NUL began publishing Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life. Believing that art and literature could lift African-Americans out of their situation, the magazine's editor, Charles S. Johnson, began printing promising black writers in each issue. During Johnson's work for Opportunity, he met Jessie Fauset , the literary editor for Du Bois' NAACP magazine, Crisis. Fauset told Johnson about her first novel, There Is Confusion (1924), a story about middle class black women. In 1924, Johnson organized the first Civic Club dinner, which was planned as a release party for Fauset's book. The party was an instant success, and served as a forum for emerging African-American artists to meet wealthy white patrons. The party managed to launch the careers of several promising black writers, including poets Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen . In 1925, shortly after the success of the Civic Club dinner, the magazine Survey Graphic, produced an issue on Harlem. Edited by black philosopher and Howard University professor, Alain Locke , the magazine featured work by prominent black writers of the time period. The magazine published work by writers Cullen, Hughes and Fauset, as well as poet Claude McKay and novelist Jean Toomer . Later that year, Locke expanded the special issue into an anthology called The New Negro. The collection fueled America's growing interest in African-American writers, pushing black artists to the literary forefront. African-American fine artists such as Aaron Douglas and Charles Alston also got their start through Alain Locke and Charles Johnson, who started publishing the artists' works as illustrations and cover art. Pulled into the spotlight, these fine artists used their fame as an opportunity to delve into the themes they found problematic to American culture. By introducing the \"exoticizing\" of Africa and notions of \"the primitive\" to white America, African-American artists had their first opportunity to explore how these ideas could be used for and against their race. The Jazz Age With the conclusion of WWI came an end to wartime frugality and conservation. In an era of peace, Americans experienced an economic boom, as well as a change in social morays. Nicknamed \"The Roaring 20s\" for its dynamic changes, the decade became known for its celebration of excess and its rejection of wartime ideologies. Americans also began investing more time and money in leisure activities and artistic endeavors. Around this same time, Congress ratified the Prohibition Act. While the amendment did not ban the actual consumption of alcohol, it made obtaining it legally difficult. Liquor-serving nightclubs, called \"speakeasies\" developed during this time as a way to allow Americans to socialize, indulge in alcohol consumption, and rebel against the traditional culture. One of the best speakeasies in Harlem was the Cotton Club, a place that intended to have the look and feel of a luxurious Southern plantation. To complete the theme, only African-American entertainers could perform there, while only white clientele (with few exceptions) were allowed to patronize the establishment. This attracted high-powered celebrity visitors such as Cole Porter , Bing Crosby and Doris Duke to see the most talented black entertainers of the day. Some of the most famous jazz performers of the time - including singer Lena Horne , composer and musician Duke Ellington , and singer Cab Calloway - graced the Cotton Club stage. Attending clubs in Harlem allowed whites from New York and its surrounding areas to indulge in two taboos simultaneously: to drink, as well as mingle with blacks. Jazz musicians often performed in these clubs, exposing white clientele to what was typically an African-American form of musical entertainment. As jazz hit the mainstream, many members of older generations began associating the raucous behavior of young people of the decade with jazz music. They started referring to the 20s, along with its new dance styles and racy fashions, as \"The Jazz Age.\" The End of the Renaissance As the 20s came to a close, so did white America's infatuation with Harlem- and the artistic and intellectual movements surrounding it. The advent of The Great Depression also crushed the wild enthusiasm of \"The Roaring 20s,\" bringing an end to the decadence and indulgence that fueled the patronage of Harlem artists and their establishments. The depression hit the African-American segment of the population hard; layoffs and housing foreclosures shut many blacks out of the American Dream that previously seemed so close at hand. The increased economic tension of the Depression caused black leaders to shift their focus from arts and culture to the financial and social issues of the time. In addition, the strained relationship between the black community and the white shop-owners in Harlem finally tore the two groups apart in 1935. That alienation was expressed in the Harlem Riot of 1935, the nation's first modem race riot. The resulting violence finally shattered the notion of Harlem as the \"Mecca\" for African-Americans, and broke the fleeting truce between white and black America. While the Renaissance as a historical movement was over, the effects it had on modern society were far from finished. The artistic and political movements of the 20s would live on in American culture in the form of new musical expression, award-winning writing and, most importantly, the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s. These events, and the role Harlem would continue to play after the Renaissance, would change the American cultural landscape forever. \n",

You had better hope those documents are in the Tegra-Lite Bulletproof Attach. Pretty much everything about the case is over the top. Its body is made out of 65 layers of a polypropylene thermoplastic composite, it costs a whopping $US5995, and only 28 are being made. At least someone realised the demand probably won't be too high. As you might expect from an attach that caters to the spy-minded, it also has a false bottom and a handcuff ring. It also has a spot for your iPad, and it weighs 5.4kg so you can use it to fend off melee attackers. The best defence against bullets is to not be shot at in the first place, but a bulletproof attach might be a close second. Gotta keep all your precious crayon doodlings safe somehow, right?

There's no pushing and no uncomfortable feeling when in the shop. I have 3 more tats in mind and I wouldn't go anywhere else. Review from Lauren D. This business should be shut down.The customer service is terrible and they stole $400 from me. I had a large tattoo that I was going to do in 2 session. I started it in March of 2008 and circumstances prevented me from coming back until recently. Also,I was leary of going back to get it finished because it healed terribly. When I called to tell them that they would have to touch it up, Robert blamed me for not healing it properly,even though I have 5 other tattoos that all healed fine. When I called in Feb to schedule the final session, Robert claimed that the work they already did was $600 worth of tattooing. LIES! So I went in with my friend who is a tattoo artist, he and immediatlely insulted her and told me to leave. I have since been calling at least once a week and he keeps screwing me over by telling me I have to talk to the artist, then never putting the artist on the phone. I finally got ahold of the artist, and he claims the same thing...the he never told me he would do the tattoo in 2 sessions, and the work he did was it. He continued to be a jerk to me on the phone, so I called him a liar and hung up. \n",

            "012?This is a case series of six patients who presented with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The aim is to understand these clinicoradiological features of PRES and its management Abstract These are case series with six patients who presented with Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome related to severe hypertension due to various causes managed by neurology team based in DGH & Tertiary neurosciences centre. This series shows the diversity of its presentation and quick recognisation and management would help in reversing the damage but there are situation were controlling hypertension becomes difficult due to nature of the aetiology of the hypertension as a result this could lead to non reversible damages. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome also called as PRES is a clinico radiological syndrome with severe hypertension, altered sensorium, seizures, visual symptoms and MRI features of changes involving predominantly the occipitopareital areas, cerebellum, BS. Prompt treatment with antihypertensive to bring down the blood pressure had been effective in reversing the damage. Understanding the tolerability and the safe practice in management of hypertension and possible adverse effects due to difficulties in controlling blood pressure with various comorbidity is very important. At present commonly used protocols are Labetalol or Glyceryl tri nitrate infusion and maintenance with single or combination therapy. Most of the critical care physicians worldwide favour labetalol and sodium nitroprusside with caution. What ever antihypertensive agents we use the evidences suggest to concentrate in bringing mean arterial pressure down by 25% in first 2 -- 4?h is a reasonably approach. PRES is otherwise a neurological emergency which can present as severe head ache, status epilepticus, posterior circulation infarct, acute visual loss? cause with severe hypertension. \n",
            "017 The Time Meddler And so it begins. Gallifrey begins to emerge into the Doctor Who mythos, ready to take it's grand place alongside other significant Who staples. At last the noble race of Time Lords can stand revealed as we learn just where the Doctor came from. Except we don't. Don't worry, we will. Gallifrey, as Rassilon proclaimed not long ago, will rise. But The Time Meddler is more akin to a sneak peek and the Monk a rather less than sterling example of Gallifrey's finest. But I'm getting ahead of myself. We open on a rather sinister looking clock ticking away. It's obviously an attempt at foreshadowing, but it just doesn't quite work for me. It puts me more in mind of the opening of Back to the Future. What is effective is the shot of the Doctor standing over the TARDIS controls as if he's just left Bad Wolf Bay, even without knowing what has gone before you can tell just looking at William Hartnell that he's suffered some kind of loss. Vicki is kind enough to bring us up to speed by discussing the recent departure of Ian and Barbara. It's quite easy to dismiss the importance of this event nearly half a century later, but their departure left Hartnell as the only remaining cast member from the opening episode. In a moment that sadly doesn't seem to have set a precedent the Doctor freely admits to being saddened by their departure. This isn't yet the gallivanting alien who picks up and deposits passengers like a interdimensional taxi driver, this is a man who is hurt enough by his abandonment to let it show and it's quite disconcerting. \"We may land in their time one day and be able to discuss old times.\" We know they won't. Even once the Doctor finally learns to fly the TARDIS we know that he seldom revisits old friendships outside of Sarah Jane and the Brig, but it leaves the door open nicely for Ian and Barbara to return and for the audience to not feel they're gone forever. As luck would have it just as Vicki and the Doctor are bemoaning their lack of company they hear what they presume to be a Dalek wondering round the TARDIS. It turns out instead to be Steven Taylor, played by Peter Purves  (yes him from Crufts) rather than Jack Davenport. Whist Steven recovers with his cuddly panda (I'm not joking) the TARDIS materialises on a beach, observed by a lone monk.  He seems intrigued about the TARDIS, but not overly shocked. Almost as if he knows more than he should. The first time I saw The Time Meddler I was genuinely intrigued about the monk, after all the Internet had yet to spoil most of the series for me. I'd imagine that most of you reading this review know fine well that the monk is in fact a Time Lord? No? Ah. Spoilers. Should have said.

The highlights for me include the horizontal control and \"a chair with a panda on it.\" The tour concludes with the Doctor making a request of the new companion. \"Please stop buggering me.\" It's safe to presume from Vicki's face that this wasn't the intended line, however I can state with absolute certainty that whatever was initially scripted wasn't nearly as amusing. Steven's disbelief is somewhat refreshing. No polite disbelief or incredulous looks for him. As far as he's concerned this old man is off his rocker, but he takes it in good humour and continues to gently mock the Doctor for the rest of the episode. Indeed his mock interrogation of the Doctor's story leads to details of the craft being given within ear shot of the Monk's hearing. It's at this point I had to remind myself that this was made in the 60s. It's early days for the show's mythos and there is absolutely no reason that the Doctor should be able to sense the Monk just because he could sense the Master in his Tenth body. We're reminded, quite forcibly, that a lot of the show's continuity was cobbled together as it went along and that there was just no way the writers could anticipate their scripts having to conform to rules that wouldn't exist as we know them for decades to come. But I digress. As night falls on our crew it casts an eerie shadow over proceedings, that is until you hear the wildlife sounds cranked up just a little too much. I'm still trying to decide if it was a plot point or not. The night shots are beautifully realised. Just as well really as the sun sets in this serial more times than it would in a Michael Bay film. Still, it looks the part. The Doctor informs the fourth wall that he misses having a History Teacher as a companion. He's not alone, not if it means we're spared such painful conversations. After wandering off from his companions the Doctor tries to casually ascertain the year from a local stopping just short of asking what the year actually is. He later informs the fourth wall that he misses having a History Teacher as a companion. He's not alone, not if it means we're spared such painful conversations. The monks chanting that the Doctor then overhears sounds suspiciously like a bad recording. So much so that when the chanting speed suddenly varies like a tape being chewed it takes me a few moments to realise that it's a plot point rather than a prop failure (although curiously the chanting is revealed as originating on a gramophone player. Possibly high technology at the time of broadcast, being a child of the late 70s I can only guess, but it certainly isn't a tape!) The first episode ends with the Doctor being trapped by the Monk. We'll skip the second episode entirely as it feels very much like filler, probably due to the absence of the Doctor for the duration of it. When we finally catch up with him, the Doctor is casually discussing his escape with a local. Given his later fear and disdain of his fellow Time Lords he seems remarkably unconcerned about the Monk. Continuity tinted glasses again I guess. These same glasses muddy the waters somewhat when it comes to judging the Monk. On one hand he's seen healing the wounded and sick with penicillin, something quite Doctor-like, and then we see him consulting his eight point plan for villainy. Seriously. He has an actual plan on a pull down chart. 'Position Atomic Canon' followed by 'Sight Vikings' gives you an idea of just how well thought out his plan is. But the Monk isn't the highlight of this episode, it's the Doctor himself. The time off seems to have worked wonders for Hartnell and he returns in sparkling form and seems to relish taking on the Monk. A shame then that the Monk fails to live up to any kind of challenge. Having said that, their dialogue in the last episode gives us our first glimpse of where these Time Lords have come from. \"You know as well as I do the golden rule about space and time travelling\" \"Never, never interfere with the course of history.\" \"Who says so?\" Asks the Monk and the thought occurs that his dialogue wouldn't be out of place spoken by the Fourth Doctor and to prove the point he finishes with \"It's more fun my way.\" As the Monk rattles off his list of achievements to date you can't help but agree with him.  Then when he mentions his hand in building Stonehenge you begin to wonder just who it was that built the Pandorica for the Alliance. Continuity Tinted Glasses again and if you watch this episode wearing them then you can't help but be struck by the sheer hypocrisy of the Doctor. Throughout this story the Doctor acts more like the Time Lords he's running from rather than the free spirit he's set to become, but when you consider that he only seems to be fifty years away from Gallifrey according to the Monk then it's really not that surprising he's still holding on to some of the basic tenets that he was raised with. His final solution of trapping the Monk on earth without a functioning TARDIS actually works better with the continuity glasses as it eerily foreshadows the Pertwee era. Speaking of the Monk's TARDIS, it's reveal at the end of Episode 3 must have been truly staggering at it's first showing. No-one knew anything of where the Doctor came from and to discover one of his own kind half way through an historical must have been staggering for the audience of the time. Ultimately The Time Meddler works best for what it implies rather than what it shows. The Monk isn't anything close to a match for the Doctor despite superior equipment and could never be the Master in my mind, regardless of what some fan theories have suggested. However through his dialogue with the Doctor we learn an awful lot about where they came from and just who the Doctor might have been before we met him. And this wouldn't be the last time we met a Time Lord. Indeed, we might even meet this particular Time Lord again... I'll leave you with the highlight for me though; an exchange between Vicki and Steven discussing the implications of meddling with time. \"Memories will change\" we're told. It's an explanation for every continuity error made during the fifty year run given, for all intents and purposes, at the very start of the run. Yet people still get upset when some things don't match up perfectly between episodes. About the author Alasdair Shaw dabbled in Who throughout the 80s, but didn't really get into it properly until 1989. His sense of timing has not improved over the years. He's a third generation Who fan as well as a father of two. His wife has a bad feeling about those two facts. When not working as a lab technician or writing for Kasterborous Alasdair runs the Doctor Who Reprint Society for which he writes In Print and Dangling Threads. He's a big fan of the Valeyard, but that's neither here nor there. He has never worked for UNIT and is not related to Dr Liz Shaw. we were so excited when we saw the inside of the monk's Tardis. It's difficult to explain how magical the Tardis control room was. It was the santuary, the place of safety that could be maddeningly out of reach. That is why the cliff hanger in the Web planet where the Tardis was apparently lost worked so well for us \"...there is absolutely no reason that the Doctor should be able to sense the Monk just because he could sense the Master in his Tenth body\" -- maybe the Dr/other Time Lords can only sense the presence of high-ranking Time Lords; perhaps the Monk just doesn't cut it? Interestingly, the Dr later senses the presence of the presumed-dead Morbius, when he's being drugged via the glass of wine at Solon's castle. I enjoyed reading this, AS, though I think you mean 'basic tenets he was raised with' rather than 'tenants'; but I like the idea of the Monk growing up with flatmates! I remember at the time I first saw this in the early 1990?s on BBC2 thinking the implied rape of Edith was totally unsuitable for a children's programme and totlaly out of the keep of the rest of the story. I still think that, but as Edith seems to get over it very quickly I will too! I was really impressed with the cliffhanger for part three though and Peter Butterworth is really good throughout the story. I loved the Target novelizations of the Hartnell stories in the eighties, but being too young to have watched the stories on TV I had to imagine what those years looked like. (Which was the magic of those books. They made us create our own vision of Doctor Who, and this demand on my imagination got me even more hooked on the show). But until I recently sat down and carefully watched every Hartnell adventure, I hadn't appreciated just how good Peter Purves was. Right from the start, he was a reliable foil for the Doctor, and he gives The Time Meddler a solid, human core. His anger at the end of The Massacre is the most believable dramatic moment of the Hartnell years. I'd have loved to see him hang around longer to be a straight man to Troughton. The Monk could have been the Master, but of course it was never intended. I like to think that the Monk was Hartnell's functional equivalent of the Master. Except like many Doctor Who concepts (such as the Doctor at the time) he was unfinished and very much prototypical, unlike Troughton's War Chief (If you've ever seen the War Games you'll know what i mean). The same 80?s Master that was in the King's Demons you mean? A basic rehash of the same story you just reviewed? C'mon, even the Monk would facepalm the Master's sloppy execution in that story. I can't see why you'd be baffled by the idea that someone would like to use their imagination, so what if someone likes the idea that the Monk was the Master? It's not a crime. I simply expressed both the Monk and the War Chief's functional equivalency to the Master, I could go as far as to say Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty's relationship was functionally similar to the Third Doctor and the Master, as was intended by the production team. Doesn't mean i think they are all the same character. I was going by your opening comment; \"The Monk could of been the Master\". I'm all for linking continuities and histories together, as long as there is some logic and substance presented with the argument. Apart from being Time Lords that the Doctor has fought I can't see a single connection. I've not seen The King's Demons, but a quick glance through a synopsis reveals the Master's plan to be a little more thought out than the Monk's one. That's the beauty of it, a connection or a pattern is always in the eye of the beholder. But from a production point of view, they'll always be seperate characters, unless some future producer decides to highlight the issue. As for King's Demons, well i guess you'll just have to give it a spin. One of the Master's best wigs, and possibly his worst plan yet. Still fun to watch though What is interesting is that at the end of Episode 10 of The Daleks master Plan The Doctor strands The Monk on an ice planet and The Monk's last ever words(if we accept your reasoning) are \"I'll get you for this Doctor! I'll get you one day!\" In \"Terror of the Autons\" (The Master's supposed \"first\" appearance) a Time Lord comes to warn The Doctor that \"an old acquaintance has arrived on this planet\" and that he \"has learnt a great deal since you last met him\". The original script also noted that \"The Master\" was a new alias, and that the Doctor had ruined one of \"The Master\"'s schemes, and that \"The Master\" was out for revenge. The Doctor is unimpressed \"That jackanapes! All hes does is cause trouble!\" he states and later \"I refuse to be worried by a renegade like The Master. He's a, he's an unimaginative plodder.\" It is only when he sees that \"The Master\" has indeed learnt a great deal since they last met that he takes the threat seriously. And we know that when they last met The Master could not have been in his Delgado incarnation when The Doctor fails to recognise the voice on the telephone. Then there's the fact that The Monk was always going on about his \"master plan\". Or the fact that the Time lord specifically states that The Master scored higher marks in science than The Doctor. The Monk was able to fix his faulty chameleon circuit(which The Doctor never did), and escape from 1066 in a TARDIS with a shrunken interior. It makes no sense he would never come after The Doctor again. And where was The Doctor's prior(to Autons) meeting with The Master? The Master of Logopolis is reckless like The Monk. And Doctor Who Magazine ran an article shortly before the aforementioned King's Demons stating that it would feature the return of a villain first seen in The Time Meddler. Quite frankly, the idea that The Monk ISN'T The Master is what I find bizarre. \n",

renaissance after the american civil war, liberated african-americans searched for a safe place to explore their new identities as free men and women. they found it in harlem. read on to find out how this new york neighborhood became home to some of the best and brightest minds of the 20th century, gave birth to a cultural revolution, and earned its status as \"the capital of black america.\" the great migration the end of the american civil war in 1865 ushered in an era of increased education and employment opportunities for black americans. this created the first black middle class in america, and its members began expecting the same lifestyle afforded to white americans. but in 1896, racial equality was delivered a crushing blow when the plessy v. ferguson supreme court case declared racial segregation to be constitutionally acceptable. this created even harsher conditions for african-americans, particularly in some southern states that sought to minimize the equality that former slaves and their descendants might aspire toward. the south also became gradually more and more economically depressed as boll weevils began to infest cotton crops. this reduced the amount of labor needed in the south. as a result, blacks began to head to the northern united states by the millions. racism, while still a serious obstacle, was considered much less brutal there than in the south. in addition, the north granted all adult men with the right to vote; provided better educational advancement for african-americans and their children; and offered greater job opportunities as a result of world war i and the industrial revolution. this phenomenon, known as the great migration, brought more than seven million african-americans to the north. harlem: the black mecca housing executives planned to create neighborhoods in harlem designed specifically for white workers who wanted to commute into the city. developers grew overambitious, however, and housing grew more rapidly than the transportation necessary to bring residents into the downtown area. the once exclusive district was abandoned by the white middle-class, and frustrated developers were forced to cope with lower purchase prices than they first anticipated. white harlem landlords started selling their properties to black real estate agents such as philip a. payton, john e. nail, and henry c. parker. they also began renting directly to black tenants. meanwhile, the re-development and gentrification of midtown pushed many blacks out of the metropolitan area. as a result, african-americans began moving to harlem en masse; between 1900 and 1920 the number of blacks in the new york city neighborhood doubled. by the time the planned subway system and roadways reached harlem, many of the country's best and brightest black advocates, artists, entrepreneurs, and intellectuals had situated themselves in harlem. they brought with them not only the institutions and businesses necessary to support themselves, but a vast array of talents and ambitions. the area soon became known as \"the black mecca\" and \"the capital of black america.\" the harlem renaissance during the early 1900s, the burgeoning african-american middle class began pushing a new political agenda that advocated racial equality. the epicenter of this movement was in new york, where three of the largest civil rights groups established their headquarters. black historian, sociologist, and harvard scholar, w. e. b. du bois was at the forefront of the civil rights movement at this time. in 1905 du bois, in collaboration with a group of prominent african-american political activists and white civil rights workers, met in new york to discuss the challenges facing the black community. in 1909, the group founded the national association for the advancement of colored people (naacp), to promote civil rights and fight african-american disenfranchisement. at this same time, the jamaican-born marcus garvey began his promotion of the \"back to africa movement.\" garvey founded the universal negro improvement association and african communities league (unia-acl), which advocated the reuniting of all people of african ancestry into one community with one absolute government. the movement not only encouraged african-americans to come together, but to also feel pride in their heritage and race. the national urban league (nul) also came into being in the early 20th century. founded by ruth standish baldwin and dr. george edmund haynes, the fledgling organization counseled black migrants from the south, trained black social workers, and worked to give educational and employment opportunities to blacks. together, these groups helped to establish a sense of community and empowerment for african-americans not only in new york, but also around the country. in addition, they provided a rare opportunity for whites to collaborate with black intellectuals, social activists, educators, and artists in an attempt to transform a largely segregated and racist american society. instead of using more direct political means to achieve their goals, african-american civil rights activists employed the artists and writers of their culture to work for the goals of civil rights and equality. jazz music, african-american fine art, and black literature were all absorbed into mainstream culture, bringing attention to a previously disenfranchised segment of the american population. this blossoming of african-american culture in european-american society, particularly in the worlds of art and music, became known as the harlem renaissance. culture comes together one of the first notable events of the renaissance came shortly after the nul began publishing opportunity: a journal of negro life. believing that art and literature could lift african-americans out of their situation, the magazine's editor, charles s. johnson, began printing promising black writers in each issue. during johnson's work for opportunity, he met jessie fauset , the literary editor for du bois' naacp magazine, crisis. fauset told johnson about her first novel, there is confusion (1924), a story about middle class black women. in 1924, johnson organized the first civic club dinner, which was planned as a release party for fauset's book. the party was an instant success, and served as a forum for emerging african-american artists to meet wealthy white patrons. the party managed to launch the careers of several promising black writers, including poets langston hughes and countee cullen . in 1925, shortly after the success of the civic club dinner, the magazine survey graphic, produced an issue on harlem. edited by black philosopher and howard university professor, alain locke , the magazine featured work by prominent black writers of the time period. the magazine published work by writers cullen, hughes and fauset, as well as poet claude mckay and novelist jean toomer . later that year, locke expanded the special issue into an anthology called the new negro. the collection fueled america's growing interest in african-american writers, pushing black artists to the literary forefront. african-american fine artists such as aaron douglas and charles alston also got their start through alain locke and charles johnson, who started publishing the artists' works as illustrations and cover art. pulled into the spotlight, these fine artists used their fame as an opportunity to delve into the themes they found problematic to american culture. by introducing the \"exoticizing\" of africa and notions of \"the primitive\" to white america, african-american artists had their first opportunity to explore how these ideas could be used for and against their race. the jazz age with the conclusion of wwi came an end to wartime frugality and conservation. in an era of peace, americans experienced an economic boom, as well as a change in social morays. nicknamed \"the roaring 20s\" for its dynamic changes, the decade became known for its celebration of excess and its rejection of wartime ideologies. americans also began investing more time and money in leisure activities and artistic endeavors. around this same time, congress ratified the prohibition act. while the amendment did not ban the actual consumption of alcohol, it made obtaining it legally difficult. liquor-serving nightclubs, called \"speakeasies\" developed during this time as a way to allow americans to socialize, indulge in alcohol consumption, and rebel against the traditional culture. one of the best speakeasies in harlem was the cotton club, a place that intended to have the look and feel of a luxurious southern plantation. to complete the theme, only african-american entertainers could perform there, while only white clientele (with few exceptions) were allowed to patronize the establishment. this attracted high-powered celebrity visitors such as cole porter , bing crosby and doris duke to see the most talented black entertainers of the day. some of the most famous jazz performers of the time - including singer lena horne , composer and musician duke ellington , and singer cab calloway - graced the cotton club stage. attending clubs in harlem allowed whites from new york and its surrounding areas to indulge in two taboos simultaneously: to drink, as well as mingle with blacks. jazz musicians often performed in these clubs, exposing white clientele to what was typically an african-american form of musical entertainment. as jazz hit the mainstream, many members of older generations began associating the raucous behavior of young people of the decade with jazz music. they started referring to the 20s, along with its new dance styles and racy fashions, as \"the jazz age.\" the end of the renaissance as the 20s came to a close, so did white america's infatuation with harlem- and the artistic and intellectual movements surrounding it. the advent of the great depression also crushed the wild enthusiasm of \"the roaring 20s,\" bringing an end to the decadence and indulgence that fueled the patronage of harlem artists and their establishments. the depression hit the african-american segment of the population hard; layoffs and housing foreclosures shut many blacks out of the american dream that previously seemed so close at hand. the increased economic tension of the depression caused black leaders to shift their focus from arts and culture to the financial and social issues of the time. in addition, the strained relationship between the black community and the white shop-owners in harlem finally tore the two groups apart in 1935. that alienation was expressed in the harlem riot of 1935, the nation's first modem race riot. the resulting violence finally shattered the notion of harlem as the \"mecca\" for african-americans, and broke the fleeting truce between white and black america. while the renaissance as a historical movement was over, the effects it had on modern society were far from finished. the artistic and political movements of the 20s would live on in american culture in the form of new musical expression, award-winning writing and, most importantly, the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s. these events, and the role harlem would continue to play after the renaissance, would change the american cultural landscape forever. \n",

            "017 the time meddler and so it begins. gallifrey begins to emerge into the doctor who mythos, ready to take it's grand place alongside other significant who staples. at last the noble race of time lords can stand revealed as we learn just where the doctor came from. except we don't. don't worry, we will. gallifrey, as rassilon proclaimed not long ago, will rise. but the time meddler is more akin to a sneak peek and the monk a rather less than sterling example of gallifrey's finest. but i'm getting ahead of myself. we open on a rather sinister looking clock ticking away. it's obviously an attempt at foreshadowing, but it just doesn't quite work for me. it puts me more in mind of the opening of back to the future. what is effective is the shot of the doctor standing over the tardis controls as if he's just left bad wolf bay, even without knowing what has gone before you can tell just looking at william hartnell that he's suffered some kind of loss. vicki is kind enough to bring us up to speed by discussing the recent departure of ian and barbara. it's quite easy to dismiss the importance of this event nearly half a century later, but their departure left hartnell as the only remaining cast member from the opening episode. in a moment that sadly doesn't seem to have set a precedent the doctor freely admits to being saddened by their departure. this isn't yet the gallivanting alien who picks up and deposits passengers like a interdimensional taxi driver, this is a man who is hurt enough by his abandonment to let it show and it's quite disconcerting. \"we may land in their time one day and be able to discuss old times.\" we know they won't. even once the doctor finally learns to fly the tardis we know that he seldom revisits old friendships outside of sarah jane and the brig, but it leaves the door open nicely for ian and barbara to return and for the audience to not feel they're gone forever. as luck would have it just as vicki and the doctor are bemoaning their lack of company they hear what they presume to be a dalek wondering round the tardis. it turns out instead to be steven taylor, played by peter purves  (yes him from crufts) rather than jack davenport. whist steven recovers with his cuddly panda (i'm not joking) the tardis materialises on a beach, observed by a lone monk.  he seems intrigued about the tardis, but not overly shocked. almost as if he knows more than he should. the first time i saw the time meddler i was genuinely intrigued about the monk, after all the internet had yet to spoil most of the series for me. i'd imagine that most of you reading this review know fine well that the monk is in fact a time lord? no? ah. spoilers. should have said. in the tardis steven is being given a guided tour of his new home. the highlights for me include the horizontal control and \"a chair with a panda on it.\" the tour concludes with the doctor making a request of the new companion: \"please stop buggering me.\" meanwhile, back in the tardis steven is being given a guided tour of his new home. the highlights for me include the horizontal control and \"a chair with a panda on it.\" the tour concludes with the doctor making a request of the new companion. \"please stop buggering me.\" it's safe to presume from vicki's face that this wasn't the intended line, however i can state with absolute certainty that whatever was initially scripted wasn't nearly as amusing. steven's disbelief is somewhat refreshing. no polite disbelief or incredulous looks for him. as far as he's concerned this old man is off his rocker, but he takes it in good humour and continues to gently mock the doctor for the rest of the episode. indeed his mock interrogation of the doctor's story leads to details of the craft being given within ear shot of the monk's hearing. it's at this point i had to remind myself that this was made in the 60s. it's early days for the show's mythos and there is absolutely no reason that the doctor should be able to sense the monk just because he could sense the master in his tenth body. we're reminded, quite forcibly, that a lot of the show's continuity was cobbled together as it went along and that there was just no way the writers could anticipate their scripts having to conform to rules that wouldn't exist as we know them for decades to come. but i digress. as night falls on our crew it casts an eerie shadow over proceedings, that is until you hear the wildlife sounds cranked up just a little too much. i'm still trying to decide if it was a plot point or not. the night shots are beautifully realised. just as well really as the sun sets in this serial more times than it would in a michael bay film. still, it looks the part. the doctor informs the fourth wall that he misses having a history teacher as a companion. he's not alone, not if it means we're spared such painful conversations. after wandering off from his companions the doctor tries to casually ascertain the year from a local stopping just short of asking what the year actually is. he later informs the fourth wall that he misses having a history teacher as a companion. he's not alone, not if it means we're spared such painful conversations. the monks chanting that the doctor then overhears sounds suspiciously like a bad recording. so much so that when the chanting speed suddenly varies like a tape being chewed it takes me a few moments to realise that it's a plot point rather than a prop failure (although curiously the chanting is revealed as originating on a gramophone player. possibly high technology at the time of broadcast, being a child of the late 70s i can only guess, but it certainly isn't a tape!) the first episode ends with the doctor being trapped by the monk. we'll skip the second episode entirely as it feels very much like filler, probably due to the absence of the doctor for the duration of it. when we finally catch up with him, the doctor is casually discussing his escape with a local. given his later fear and disdain of his fellow time lords he seems remarkably unconcerned about the monk. continuity tinted glasses again i guess. these same glasses muddy the waters somewhat when it comes to judging the monk. on one hand he's seen healing the wounded and sick with penicillin, something quite doctor-like, and then we see him consulting his eight point plan for villainy. seriously. he has an actual plan on a pull down chart. 'position atomic canon' followed by 'sight vikings' gives you an idea of just how well thought out his plan is. but the monk isn't the highlight of this episode, it's the doctor himself. the time off seems to have worked wonders for hartnell and he returns in sparkling form and seems to relish taking on the monk. a shame then that the monk fails to live up to any kind of challenge. having said that, their dialogue in the last episode gives us our first glimpse of where these time lords have come from. \"you know as well as i do the golden rule about space and time travelling\" \"never, never interfere with the course of history.\" \"who says so?\" asks the monk and the thought occurs that his dialogue wouldn't be out of place spoken by the fourth doctor and to prove the point he finishes with \"it's more fun my way.\" as the monk rattles off his list of achievements to date you can't help but agree with him.  then when he mentions his hand in building stonehenge you begin to wonder just who it was that built the pandorica for the alliance. continuity tinted glasses again and if you watch this episode wearing them then you can't help but be struck by the sheer hypocrisy of the doctor. throughout this story the doctor acts more like the time lords he's running from rather than the free spirit he's set to become, but when you consider that he only seems to be fifty years away from gallifrey according to the monk then it's really not that surprising he's still holding on to some of the basic tenets that he was raised with. his final solution of trapping the monk on earth without a functioning tardis actually works better with the continuity glasses as it eerily foreshadows the pertwee era. speaking of the monk's tardis, it's reveal at the end of episode 3 must have been truly staggering at it's first showing. no-one knew anything of where the doctor came from and to discover one of his own kind half way through an historical must have been staggering for the audience of the time. ultimately the time meddler works best for what it implies rather than what it shows. the monk isn't anything close to a match for the doctor despite superior equipment and could never be the master in my mind, regardless of what some fan theories have suggested. however through his dialogue with the doctor we learn an awful lot about where they came from and just who the doctor might have been before we met him. and this wouldn't be the last time we met a time lord. indeed, we might even meet this particular time lord again... i'll leave you with the highlight for me though; an exchange between vicki and steven discussing the implications of meddling with time. \"memories will change\" we're told. it's an explanation for every continuity error made during the fifty year run given, for all intents and purposes, at the very start of the run. yet people still get upset when some things don't match up perfectly between episodes. about the author alasdair shaw dabbled in who throughout the 80s, but didn't really get into it properly until 1989. his sense of timing has not improved over the years. he's a third generation who fan as well as a father of two. his wife has a bad feeling about those two facts. when not working as a lab technician or writing for kasterborous alasdair runs the doctor who reprint society for which he writes in print and dangling threads. he's a big fan of the valeyard, but that's neither here nor there. he has never worked for unit and is not related to dr liz shaw. we were so excited when we saw the inside of the monk's tardis. it's difficult to explain how magical the tardis control room was. it was the santuary, the place of safety that could be maddeningly out of reach. that is why the cliff hanger in the web planet where the tardis was apparently lost worked so well for us \"...there is absolutely no reason that the doctor should be able to sense the monk just because he could sense the master in his tenth body\" -- maybe the dr/other time lords can only sense the presence of high-ranking time lords; perhaps the monk just doesn't cut it? interestingly, the dr later senses the presence of the presumed-dead morbius, when he's being drugged via the glass of wine at solon's castle. i enjoyed reading this, as, though i think you mean 'basic tenets he was raised with' rather than 'tenants'; but i like the idea of the monk growing up with flatmates! i remember at the time i first saw this in the early 1990?s on bbc2 thinking the implied rape of edith was totally unsuitable for a children's programme and totlaly out of the keep of the rest of the story. i still think that, but as edith seems to get over it very quickly i will too! i was really impressed with the cliffhanger for part three though and peter butterworth is really good throughout the story. i loved the target novelizations of the hartnell stories in the eighties, but being too young to have watched the stories on tv i had to imagine what those years looked like. (which was the magic of those books. they made us create our own vision of doctor who, and this demand on my imagination got me even more hooked on the show). but until i recently sat down and carefully watched every hartnell adventure, i hadn't appreciated just how good peter purves was. right from the start, he was a reliable foil for the doctor, and he gives the time meddler a solid, human core. his anger at the end of the massacre is the most believable dramatic moment of the hartnell years. i'd have loved to see him hang around longer to be a straight man to troughton. the monk could have been the master, but of course it was never intended. i like to think that the monk was hartnell's functional equivalent of the master. except like many doctor who concepts (such as the doctor at the time) he was unfinished and very much prototypical, unlike troughton's war chief (if you've ever seen the war games you'll know what i mean). the same 80?s master that was in the king's demons you mean? a basic rehash of the same story you just reviewed? c'mon, even the monk would facepalm the master's sloppy execution in that story. i can't see why you'd be baffled by the idea that someone would like to use their imagination, so what if someone likes the idea that the monk was the master? it's not a crime. i simply expressed both the monk and the war chief's functional equivalency to the master, i could go as far as to say sherlock holmes and moriarty's relationship was functionally similar to the third doctor and the master, as was intended by the production team. doesn't mean i think they are all the same character. i was going by your opening comment; \"the monk could of been the master\". i'm all for linking continuities and histories together, as long as there is some logic and substance presented with the argument. apart from being time lords that the doctor has fought i can't see a single connection. i've not seen the king's demons, but a quick glance through a synopsis reveals the master's plan to be a little more thought out than the monk's one. that's the beauty of it, a connection or a pattern is always in the eye of the beholder. but from a production point of view, they'll always be seperate characters, unless some future producer decides to highlight the issue. as for king's demons, well i guess you'll just have to give it a spin. one of the master's best wigs, and possibly his worst plan yet. still fun to watch though what is interesting is that at the end of episode 10 of the daleks master plan the doctor strands the monk on an ice planet and the monk's last ever words(if we accept your reasoning) are \"i'll get you for this doctor! i'll get you one day!\" in \"terror of the autons\" (the master's supposed \"first\" appearance) a time lord comes to warn the doctor that \"an old acquaintance has arrived on this planet\" and that he \"has learnt a great deal since you last met him\". the original script also noted that \"the master\" was a new alias, and that the doctor had ruined one of \"the master\"'s schemes, and that \"the master\" was out for revenge. the doctor is unimpressed \"that jackanapes! all hes does is cause trouble!\" he states and later \"i refuse to be worried by a renegade like the master. he's a, he's an unimaginative plodder.\" it is only when he sees that \"the master\" has indeed learnt a great deal since they last met that he takes the threat seriously. and we know that when they last met the master could not have been in his delgado incarnation when the doctor fails to recognise the voice on the telephone. then there's the fact that the monk was always going on about his \"master plan\". or the fact that the time lord specifically states that the master scored higher marks in science than the doctor. the monk was able to fix his faulty chameleon circuit(which the doctor never did), and escape from 1066 in a tardis with a shrunken interior. it makes no sense he would never come after the doctor again. and where was the doctor's prior(to autons) meeting with the master? the master of logopolis is reckless like the monk. and doctor who magazine ran an article shortly before the aforementioned king's demons stating that it would feature the return of a villain first seen in the time meddler. quite frankly, the idea that the monk isn't the master is what i find bizarre. \n",

            "01 november 2012 the writers of our songs are the true national leaders \"let me write the songs of a nation: i don't care who writes the laws\" - andrew fletcher, scottish politician when he first took office i used to hear news about governor powes parkop's vision to clean the city and the people's mindsets by the year 2012. with that year coming to an end now, how have we fared? have we changed? parkop posed the question to a workshop of certain middle level bureaucrats, \"how do we get people to change their mindsets and attitudes?\" indeed: \"how?\" mindsets and attitudes cannot be legislated or regulated into being. they exist free of the external things we set up to control society. conscience is the freest component of a human person. inserted and guaranteed by god himself. i could even say that the freedom of conscience is a freedom more precious than liberty itself. throughout history and even today people have sacrificed their physical freedom and even their lives to keep their consciences free. and the most powerful of people have been those who have been able to permeate people's conscience. leadership, i heard from myles munroe, is the ability to influence human behaviour. human behaviour is a product of the human conscience. leadership is therefore the ability to influence the human conscience to such an extent as it affects human behaviour. all these matters considered, i have concluded who the real leaders of this nation are. they are not the prime ministers, the members of parliament or the nation's top bureaucrats. they are not the ones who possess power or control over vast amounts of money or land or people. they are not those who have many wives and massive wealth; or who drive successful businesses and expensive vehicles. for me, the true leaders are smaller people. they probably live with relatives because they can't afford rentals. maybe they make their homes in settlements. they possibly have small blue-collar jobs that they struggle through every day. but they are famous people. known and loved by many who share the same everyday experiences they do. they are the local songwriters, singers, poets, writers and the storytellers. but i'll focus on the songwriters and singers because that segment of the arts has more dominion in png than the storytelling, books and poetry. the majority in this nation listens to music and song every day. and songs have the ability to stick and continually play in the minds of people. the words, aided by music, can seep easily into our subconscious, shaping the mindset without us even knowing it. when we constantly listen to the same thing we usually end up believing it -- without even making a conscious decision to start believing. sooner or later we start living out the kind of beliefs transmitted by the songs. our behaviour is affected. human behaviour is shaped by what we constantly hear, see and read -- by what is constantly communicated to us. politicians can deliver speeches once in a while but their words do not dwell in our minds and hearts as much as songs and music. hence politicians, despite having the authority to make laws and the macro-decisions for the country, do not have much influence on the people's behaviour. that privilege (or responsibility) lies with our song-writers and singers. the problem, however, is that many popular local songs are full of negative themes such as self-pity and regret, low self-esteem, loss of hope (\"i give up\") etc. they are uninspiring and narrow-minded. they stimulate fleeting desires that can never be satisfied. those words, and the phrase \"i'm living for the weekend\", reinforce within young people that life has no ultimate meaning or everlasting joy, but if we compound our pleasures every weekend -- by taking alcohol, dancing away and picking up a one-night stand -- we may salvage some happiness. this is a dangerous message. yet this song is (was) a hit with very young children who had yet to cement a proper outlook of life. then there's tania's trupla man. i once watched a tv program showcasing tania promoting that song to hundreds of kids mostly below the age of 13. some kids (possibly aged between 7 and 10) were called to the stage and sang the chorus brilliantly: \" trupla man, wokobaut long bikpla nait. painim mi. em orait. mi save long ting ting blong yu !...\" (\"a real man walks in the dead of the night looking for me. that's fine. i know what you're thinking\") i thought to myself, \"what the heck!\" these kids are singing along without a clue as to what tania's intent was (i doubt tania herself knew). but very early a mentality is being embedded into their subconscious. it is, if your body desires something, get out there and do what it takes to satisfy your body. and if you do so you are a \" trupla man \" (real man)! such songs are dangerous to our society. they summon up energies and curiosities within children and young people before they have built strong foundations from which they can properly direct such energy. they lack a message of hope, peace, unity and other positive themes that could energise papua new guineans to do the right thing. yes we do have some of those more uplifting songs ringing through the air, but they're significantly outnumbered by the negative. songs with such words are not just harmless music and entertainment. they shape human thought. they shape the conscience. they shape culture. if there are songwriters out there reading this, you have more power than you know. use it well. as for politicians, if you'd like to regain some of your lost power from the singers and songwriters, i recommend you ban the so many negatively-charged songs that infiltrate almost every young heart every single day in papua new guinea. if we are to have a positive society with a positive culture we have to change the things that shape the minds that shape the behaviour of the people that shape our society. comments you can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post. song lyrics are, for the greater part, geared towards entertainment. they reflect a certain frame of mind that the singer feels and wants to relate to the audience. poetry, the less appreciated root of song lyrics, is more fundamental - poetry searches, poetry questions, poetry plumbs the depths of who we are and what we believe. problem is most people just don't have the time. you could say that we'd rather be brain-washed through song than asked than meditate on poetry. hear, hear! you just hit the nail on the head, ganjiki. this is something i have been bemoaning for a long while now and you articulated it brilliantly for me there. i totally agree with you. however, your recommendation of banning a song may run against the grain of our stance on free speech and freedom of expression. plus the act of banning almost always increases a creative work's marketability. something like reverse psychology, if you may. the more viable option perhaps, would be to get this message -- what you just wrote above -- to all our people, and especially our songwriters, producers and recording studios so they can take some affirmative action on this matter. for example, we could have these artists invited to a workshop and through face-to-face and small group sessions, get them to this side of the picture. make them realise the power they yield with their words in song, and how they can use it to better benefit the community, and in turn contribute to building a better society in papua new guinea. this could also provide an avenue for artists to share ideas with each other and with industry professionals on refining their music to break out of the shallow drivel of 1-beat mould. i'm sure people like allen 'ak47' kedea and even png music giants like telek (here's me hoping) would be keen to participate in such a productive exercise as well. this collaborative act would blow any other collaborations out of the water. :) while on affirmative action, there's a national symposium on arts and culture coming up next week, and i recall seeing some names from the music fraternity like pati doi and oala moi in the programme lineup. guys, this agenda could surely do with some breathing room on the podium. \n",

            "02.14.10 fernando \"terremoto\" performing a bulerias in the pea tio jos de paula in jerez one only had to hear the first few seconds of fernando fernandez pantoja, \"el terremoto\" (\"the earthquake\") singing to understand why he got his stage name. i was recently arrived to jerez and the flamenco scene in 1997 when i heard terremoto perform at a flamenco pea. terremoto came from a large a prestigious gypsy family from jerez, and was the son of the original \"terremoto\", a flamenco cantaor who died in 1981, who is still spoken of in the flamenco world with reverence for his tremendous voice and prowess. even as a flamenco novice i was completely mesmerised by fernando terremoto's voice, and was acutely aware that i was in the presence of a master.  he could, in the course of interpreting a flamenco style, make his voice go from the sound of thunder to the merest whisper, sustaining a note with a melisma so common in flamenco style cante but executed perfectly.  there was no question as to whether or not hearing terremoto's voice would give you goose bumps.  the question was just how many times over. terremoto, who just a year before i first saw him perform had won first prize for cante in the biennal de sevilla , became a regular fixture in the flamenco pea scene in jerez.  it was particularly gratifying for me when, taking visiting friends to see flamenco for the first time, we were fortunate enough to see him perform, to have his voice as the first flamenco cante they were exposed to.  even if one did not understand the words, he had a capacity to transmit the deepest sentiments flamenco can produce. one can only lament then, that this artist, at the age of 40, today february 13 succumbed to an illness that began exactly a year ago when his singing career was cut short and he was hospitalised with a brain tumor.  he had a brief period of recovery, performing in september of 2009 in the flamenco pea that bears his name, as well as a performance in said pea in november that i was very fortunate to have attended.  that night, not expecting to, i was once again with the hairs on the back of my neck on end, captivated by his performance.  that night, with the humility of a man who had stared death in the face he thanked profoundly the crowd who had come to see him and who cheered him at every opportunity.  little did i know that his situation would slowly deteriorate afterwards, leading to the cancellation of his planned performance in the upcoming jerez flamenco festival only a week ago.  tomorrow, february 14, at the parroqua la asuncin in jerez, his funeral will be held at 16:30.   fernando terremoto- a life cut too short....a flamenco artist from jerez without peer. \n",
            "02 august 2012 11:57 am sorry wiggo, you are wrong about cycle helmets bradley wiggins is a top bloke. he lacks the unappealing narcissism of so many athletes, gives the impression that he has a life away from the saddle and is a mod to boot. but that doesn??t stop him being (most probably) wrong about cycle helmets. on wednesday night a cyclist was killed in a collision with an olympic bus in stratford. speaking afterwards, mr wiggins said: ??ultimately, if you get knocked off and you don??t have a helmet on, then you can??t argue,?_ he said. ??you can get killed if you don??t have a helmet on.?_ well yes, that is unarguably true, but it is equally unarguably true that you can also get killed if you do have a helmet on. and here we enter one of the most vexed and controversial areas in the whole of statistics, the strange science of cycle safety. the whole issue of cycle helmets is so strange that david spiegelhalter, the very excellent professor of the public understanding of risk at cambridge university, a man who knows more about accident stats than almost anyone else, half-jokingly refuses to talk about it. ??cycle helmets?_ he once told me. ??i try not to go there.?_ the problem is that almost everything about cycle safety is counter-intuitive, and a great deal of what we think we know is in fact guesswork. this we do know: in places were the wearing of helmets has been made compulsory, such as in some australian states, cycling appears to become more dangerous and accident rates (and injuries) actually go up. why? we don??t know. maybe well-publicised compulsory helmet laws make cycling appear to be more dangerous than it is, discouraging all by the brave (and reckless) from taking to the streets. thus the number of cyclists may remain the same, but they may be drawn from a slightly different (more accident prone) population. another, almost opposite explanation also suggests itself. making people wear helmets may make cycling appear to be safer than it really is. this could encourage normally cautious types to take more risks. you see? this is far from straightforward. finally, anything which makes cycling less appealing (and many people do not like wearing helmets) will reduce cyclist numbers. it may also encourage motorists to take more chances around bikes, as they subconsciously calculate that anyone on two-wheels is ??protected??. we know other things. the safest places to ride a bike are places where the most bikes are ridden. you are far, far less likely to be killed on a bicycle on the streets of amsterdam or copenhagen than you are in new york or los angeles. the safest places to ride a bike are also places were almost no one wears a helmet at all. i don??t think i have ever seen a dutchman or woman wearing head protection, and the netherlands?? road safety record is excellent, (matching ours, in fact, as the best in the world, although it is a better place to ride a bike). more cyclists equals fewer accidents. several possible reasons for this. there??s the ??critical mass?? theory that says simply that as bikes become commonplace motorists learn to give them more space and treat them as equals. perhaps more importantly, in a rich country where almost everyone rides a bike (such as denmark) many, if not most, of these cyclists will also drive cars. the safest drivers where cyclists are concerned are also (probably) cyclists themselves. but of course the direction of the causal arrow is not entirely clear. it may be that places with safe roads, proper provision for cyclists (especially dedicated cycle lanes) simply encourage more people to cycle. it??s probably a bit of both. more statistical oddities: women, although generally less reckless on the road, are slightly more likely to come to grief on a bike. not because they are ??worse?? cyclists but in fact because they are better. there is some evidence (the department for transport has some stats on this that it tried to bury a few years ago) which suggested that highly ??law abiding?? cyclists were more likely to be killed, particularly by commercial vehicles at junctions. this is because when push comes to shove, a cyclist is very often better off ??jumping?? a red light by a few seconds to avoid being crushed by a truck??s nearside turning left (a major cause of cycle accidents). i don??t know whether wearing a cycle helmet makes it less likely that you will die on the roads or not. i suspect the latter but i wear one anyway, when i remember. i strongly suspect (although again i do not know for sure, because no one does) that making helmet-wearing compulsory will not help and will probably make things worse. i know more bikes on the road makes those bikes safer (as well as reducing traffic congestion, pollution, and so on). i know that the risks from cyclists are so minute to be irrelevant; a handful of pedestrians are killed or seriously injured by bikes every year compared to the hundreds of cyclists and pedestrians killed by cars and (especially) trucks and buses. i know that probably the single best way of encouraging more people to cycle would be the provision of proper, dedicated cycle lanes. london mayor boris johnson is a keen cyclist and must be commended for raising the profile of cycling in london but his big blue cycle lanes are for the most part merely markings on the road, not lanes where cyclists are safe from being mown down by vehicles a hundred times their weight travelling at twice their speed. cycle lanes work but they are expensive and councils see to put them at the bottom of their priority lists. finally, we can surely do something about the infestation of heavy goods vehicles in our cities. i do not fully understand why the streets of london are clogged by massive 18-wheelers whereas the streets of paris or vienna are not. bradley wiggins is (probably) wrong about cycle helmets (his comments on not listening toipods and using lights at night were bang on the money) but by giving cycling such a high profile he may be doing a great deal for cycle safety anyway, by encouraging a new generation of youngsters to take to the roads on two wheels. share this article: comments you can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post. we also have to remember when riding a bike/ car / using our legs. trust in ourselves is sadly not all that's to it. a lot of accidents can happy by other road users. not having an airbag is not at all safe! why? because you can be the safest driver in the world but it doesn't stop another driving smashing into the back of you causing your head to smash though the wind screen!!!!!! we need a more active nation, all fair and well boris bringing out his bikes but where's the safety!? what an awful article the mail has produced. how can one person say wearing a helmet can hinder people. i've seen comments taking into account of the shape of helmets and other risk facts. but this writer hasn't really made any valid points at all! \"making people wear helmets may make cycling appear to be safer than it really is. this could encourage normally cautious types to take more risks\" yes well done cycling appears safer when wearing a helmet. why? because that person is wearing a hard shell around their head that protects their skull from crushing if it hits the ground fast. surely wearing a helmet would never make a person less/more weary? perhaps wearing a helmet would make the person feel comfortable but what studies / experiments do you have about people not looking because they're so preoccupied about having something on their head!? bottom line is if children are reading this. helmets are incredibly cool! lots of people's lives could have been saved if these people wore a helmet during their accident. please consider this article as another one of the mail's failed attempt at journalism. if helmets with sticky out bits make people weary consider the 'bmx helmet' smooth round basic matte helmet, very cool and very trust worthy! i think debating whether helmets are effective and debating whether helmets should be made compulsory are two different topics. for a safety measure to be made compulsory it has to be practically enforceable. forcing and policing cyclists to wear helmets is not as such. bicycles do not come equipped with helmets that fit everyone providing the minimum level of protection, and they are not practical for the majority of the population. regular cyclists are not what we are talking about here. we are talking about people who decide to occasionally ride a bike, just like people occasionally decide to ride the london underground or a train or a bus or a taxi with children. think of the cycle hire scheme for example as a form of public transport. in those cases, exemptions are made so that the general public find such transport systems convenient. when we talk about personal transport, a cyclist must be able to carry the helmet in such a way that its integrity is not compromised. this is very impractical at the moment. let's take some examples from real life: seat belts come fitted to all cars, you don't need to carry your own seatbelt with you at all times. on the other hand, if you travel with kids and need to take a taxi, you won't be required to have a child seat. so, helmets might be the most effective way to protect from head injuries for cyclists, but due to infrequent nature of such accidents, the general consensus is that if you find yourself in a situation with higher risk for head injuries, you should be responsible for your own safety because the cost of policing that *everyone* wears one is not required. i personally wear a helmet when i figure the risk of head injuries is higher. but yes, it is left to the individual just like the choice of the type of helmet, and the choice of wearing hi-viz or wearing a spine protector or riding on segregated cycle tracks rather than mixing it with buses and pedestrians. until the level of dead or seriously injured cyclists resulting from not wearing a helmet rises significantly, it is not in the best interest of society to demand them to be made compulsory. by the way, i have been riding for many years in italy: drivers certainly did not show higher level of respect than anywhere else, including the uk. i ride about 4k miles a year and i feel safest around safe drivers, and unsafe drivers are the minority in all countries. i'm sure in all these anecdotes the word 'bike' could be exchanged for 'car' or 'walking' and they would still apply to a large number of accident victims. is there a single argument for helmet wearing on bikes that doesn't apply equally to driving or walking? wearing a helmet should be up to the cyclist, if i had worn one when i foolishly carried a package in a bap dangling from the handlebars (yes we all do it!) and i hit the groud hard, a helmet would have twisted my neck/head with fatal results as i slid (face down) on the road surface. yes i had a few grazes but my arm protected my head to some degree. medical staff have confirmed that a helmet would have twisted my head beyond the normal position. now i take more care and consider risks more often i took a paralysed cyclist to hospital for rehab. i volunteer driving for local pts. his surgeon told him that the ribs of his helmet could be responsible for breaking his neck the helmet not sliding over the road surface. the surgeon did not find the same injury with m/c helmets which are smooth. \"proper\" bike lanes are difficult. to be useful, they have to follow a direct path from a to b. many so-called bike paths follow artistic curves through parks and the like, which whilst being pleasant for a weekend jaunt aren't useful for my commute to work. the existing direct routes between a and b are generally speaking already occupied by roads, so a cycle path has to follow the road. in many cases, there just isn't room to build a physically separate path - a strip of coloured tarmac might be the best you can do. my wife and i started cycling 3 years ago as a means to keeping fit and active after finishing work. eighteen month later i touched her back wheel and came off my bike. i had scrapes on elbow and knee, cuts and brises and remember my head hitting the floor and smashing the helmet. i would probably have been dead or very seriously injured without the helmet. would you allow your children or grandchildren to ride without a helmet???? sorry wiggo is right. the same absurd \"logic\" that people apply to seatbelts - without them you drive more carefully and with them you take more risks. same with drink driving - drunk people take more care, sober people don't. i think people are debating the nature of helmets when they should be debating the nature of the law. a law requiring helmet use will probably serve mainly as a means to extract payments from those (e.g. students, teens, people who can't afford to maintain a car) not well able to afford them in the form of fines. if the police are short of cash, i fear they will implement this 'law' with excessive and pointless vigor, creating a largely victim-less crime. you do not have to be insured to ride a bike. therefore it is nobody's business but your own what you wear when cycling, and it is certainly not a police matter. i am also suspicious about commercial motivations behind the general idea that to ride safely you need loads of equipment: gloves, helmet, knee pads, sunglasses, fluorescent jackets etc, all of which add up in terms of price. i don't think this equipment helps popularize cycling as a normal, everyday means of transport and there are evidently far better ways to guarantee cyclist safety, such as the 'dutch' laws mentioned several times already. it would serve as an effective traffic calming measure and there is no question of extorting fines for trivial 'offenses' that would drive bike users off the road or otherwise persecute road users. it should go without saying that cyclists who don't follow the rules of the road should get booked like any other road user. a friend of mine was killed whilst cycling in an incident in which the car driver was going suspiciously fast. the coroner avoided blaming the driver, as it was the driver's word against the 'word' of a deceased as to what actually took place: not much of a contest really in the eyes of (willfully?) 'blind', 'impartial' justice. incidentally, i suspect the aforementioned coroner drove to and from the inquest rather than cycled and that his concept of objectivity was informed by precisely this circumstance and the less than humane desire to let sleeping dogs lie and to lead a quiet life. naturally, he chose to dwell on the fact that the deceased was not wearing a helmet and the driver does even get points on his licence. no doubt had my friend been using earphones, that would have drawn into the equation, though the car driver has, apparently, an absolute and unqualified right to listen to the radio whilst driving. i for one would never ride my mountain bike without a helmet for the simple reason i feel safer and if i happen to fall off for one reason or another then there is less risk of head injuries. one of my wifes friends husband came off his bike years ago and suffered head injuries from which he never recovered and never worked again. so think hard and say to yourself is it a hardship to wear a helmet? i think not. i suspect his reasons for saying cyclists should wear helmets are because he's sponsored by a helmet manufacture,but making helmets law will kill cycling as it did motorcycling,besides when you don't wear a helmet cars give you more room they have proved this many times and cycle helmets are only designed to withstand a 15 mph impact. one other possible explanation has been missed. which is that a helmet restricts one's ability to act or react, and it takes time to get used to this. so bradley wiggins, spending a lot of time riding, will get used to the helmet andis no longer a hindrance. to someone cycling for a few minutes a day on average, they don't get used to the encumbrance. just as i was always bumping the hard hat on things when i had to wear one as building site safety kit, but would not have hit my head since i knew wher it was. i have had enough hits or near misses from drivers who seem totally blind to cyclists, even wearing high-visibility jackets. (one in acton derided me as \"canary\" and drove onto the pavement to chase me after a near miss when he pulled away without due care.) what we do need is radical education to teach drivers how to respect cyclists, and to teach cyclists basic rules of the road. we also need to design roads to encourage cyclists - just about every recent road change in birmingham and sandwell works against cyclists. and the one thing we could make compulsory is the high-vis jacket, which need not cost more than a1 to a5 in various forms. the problem lies in a barely visible bike navigating horrid potholes and other problems sharing a very small piece of the road with vehicles that tower over them. if a bike suddenly makes a lateral move, smack! the safest cities i've ridden in were all in china where bike lanes are very carefull isolated through posts, or even bigger barriers. even passenger overheads have small ramps on the edges to acomodate cyclists. if a car cannot physically drive onto the bike lanes, then they are obviously not going to be running over people! simply painting a line on the road is not going to do the trick. i've been hit by cars three times. have you ever tried to cyce of a sewer grate surround by potholes with a car 2 feet away? i've been criticised already on here for my comments re: personal \"anecdotes\" of the benefits of helmets (john), from my clinical experience (i am still a nurse btw). 'john' has also encouraged me to undergo my own science experiment at home re: breaking of styrofoam. that's absolutely fine and i have no problem with these debates, that's what is good about them and my view was not necessarily saying there should be a law. but would people prefer a smashed helmet or smashed skull? arguing that you didn't wear a helmet because the stats proved you didn't need to won't be possible when you are 'coning' on the way to the mri scanner, with your family being told to prepare for the worst. emotive, yes. real world, yes. the real world is not a laboratory, but following that theme here's some simple medical science i can understand. imagine a cyclist's head hitting an object (floor/ car etc): ?݃?݃?݃?..which is likely to be more survivable? i know the answer from my clinical \"anecdotes\". we can argue stats till the cows come home as already mentioned, accidents do and will happen and our time is up at any moment. so it's behaviour we need to address. a helmet that may give me a fighting chance of surviving versus not wearing one is well worth it in my book. p.s. on the subject of why don't cyclists pay road tax, well it's not road tax it's emissions based tax, it doesn't give a vehicle driver any more rights than a cyclist. would you argue a disabled driver or someone who drives a zero emissions car shouldn't be on the road either then? i have to disagree with the article, i was t-boned by a car that ran a red on saturday, hit me at 50mph and i walked away with fractured wrist, battered leg and a small lump on my head. i will always wear a helmet and won't ride with anyone that doesn't. you never know when a driver will do something stupid or a rabbit/pheasant might run out in front of you while you're doing 25mph. its a personal choice but it madness to say not wearing a helmet is safer. any advice on how to claim for bike and loss of earnings?? cheers ben \"cycle lanes work but they are expensive\".........simple! make cyclists pay for their introduction and maintenance. just like motorists who pay road tax. cyclists should also pay insurance to cover the accidents they cause. a few points: 1. in holland, people generally are still pretty law-abiding. also, in a motor accident involving a cyclist, the motorist is assumed to be at fault unless proven otherwise. 2. helmets do more than save life. brain injuries are pretty horrible. 3. a few years ago in cape town, a girl on a cycle was hit by a kombi. the vehicle had to be jacked up to get her head from under the wheel, yet she had only minor injuries. don't under-estimate helmets, and wear gloves. gravel under the skin is not funny. two years ago, i woke up in the er two hours after a bicycle crash. my helmet was broken and the styrofoam partly crushed. absent the helmet, i suspect it would have been my skull that was broken. i shall continue wearing a helmet. \"there is some evidence (the department for transport has some stats on this that it tried to bury a few years ago) which suggested that highly ??law abiding?? cyclists were more likely to be killed, particularly by commercial vehicles at junctions. this is because when push comes to shove, a cyclist is very often better off ??jumping?? a red light by a few seconds to avoid being crushed by a truck??s nearside turning left (a major cause of cycle accidents).\" or, alternatively, when push comes to shove, a cyclist is very often undertaking a hgv to try to save a few seconds and is crushed by a truck??s nearside turning left (a major cause of cycle accidents). how do you equate \"law abiding\" with deliberately \"undertaking\" ? if they are going to insist on \"undertaking\", is it any wonder they are being \"buried\" ! one can argue the pro's and con's of wearing a helmet untill the cows come home but lets face it, the bike was invented when there were hardly any cars or any thing else on the road. it was in those far off days of empty roads safe to ride on. now on our congested roads it is no longer safe no matter what you wear and that's it. end of. the bike is like the dinasoures. its history i always wear a helmet, and believe it may have saved my life when i had an accident (off-road) a few years ago. i know that in a lot of accidents it would be an irrelavance, but i value my brain, so i take that precaution, buy the best helmet i can afford, and replace it at least every year. however, i don't see any point in enforcing it by law. i am not a danger to others on my bike in the way that i am when i'm driving 3/4 tonne of metal glass and plastic at thirty miles/hr. i know there are always top gear style claims of 'irresponsible' cyclists causing apocalypse whenever cycling is in the news, but, really, it's the cyclist who suffers when things go wrong, so it is the cyclist who should shoulder the responsibility for his own safety. the responsibility of the motorist is already there: it's just a shame that so many flout that duty, drive like fools and blaming their potential victims. the simplist way to address deaths of cyclists would be to make any use of earphones/headphones illegal and make all bikes used on the roads of britain have a (either) 6 monthly or yearly test (like an mot for a car), lights and reflectors fitted by law (before anyone goes on about theft of lights etc., i've got led lights front and back on my bike, which i can remove in under 10 seconds and both fit in one pocket of my jacket...) also, wearing a helmet, as pointed out in the article, would make some cyclists take more risks just as air-bags in cars have made drivers rely on their safety features (abs etc.) if you remove your air-bag from your steering wheel and replace it with a 6\" stainless steel spike, i bet you would drive a lot safer... i have been cycling on the roads of britain since i was about 8 years old, never had an accident because i'm watching what other road users are doing and taking avoiding action when needed.

            "02 june 2012 one step at a time for australia-png relations by ben jackson the first step an australian government needs to take in attempting to understand the issues and perspectives of papua new guineans is to admit that they don't understand them at all. martyn namorong and i visited parliament house in canberra last monday and tuesday with the hope of bringing a fresh perspective on the png issues of land ownership, aid distribution and the long term role of australia. in general, with martyn's visit, the federal government squandered a rare opportunity to look beyond png's diplomatic and political elite and engage with a young papua new guinean who shows a precocious ability to understand, analyse and articulate the issues facing his country. instead of seeking the insider knowledge available to them, and seeking to improve australia-png relations, our frontline decision-makers on the pacific seemed to me to be intent on self-aggrandisement. too often patronising comparisons were drawn between australia and papua new guinea and there was an underlying tone that \"it works here, so it should work over there\", with no consideration given to the huge cultural differences. the simplification of a complex truth is this: papua new guineans want their nation to be a more equitable version of png; not a miniature version of australia. there haven't been many superlatives thrown at the current federal opposition, but they have proven to be both patient and opportunistic. martyn and i were welcomed to parliament house like old mates by sam riordan -- adviser to shadow foreign affairs minister, hon julie bishop mp. we met with sam several times before the appointment with ms bishop and each time he made no assumptions about his own knowledge; he listened and asked questions of martyn. before our eventual meeting with julie bishop, martyn and i had the pleasure of meeting hon alan griffin, former minister for veterans affairs and defence personnel. by his own admission, griffin's knowledge of png is not great, but his analysis and political nous were invaluable to us. alan is a realist (he said cynic, but i think better of him) and there was no pandering or pretence that australia and png have been and always will be best friends. he listened and offered constructive, sometimes blunt, advice on how martyn should present issues to australian politicians so that in time his views might effect real change. sadly, just as many papua new guineans have been compromised by their government over the years, alan has also been disenfranchised.  a good man excluded from the inner sanctum of the labor party because of internal division. while the government languished, the ever opportunistic opposition swung in. sam riordan had heard all the right things previously and julie bishop said all the right things. this was a meeting with a future minister and policy-maker who was extremely well briefed and enthusiastic to offer suggestions on progressing australia-png relations. ms bishop was on topic and aligned with the issues martyn came to canberra to convey. i won't be so nave as to believe that everything we were told in parliament house will emerge as concrete results, but there are at least some promising murmurs that might be enacted as foreign policy in the future. ben jackson managed the program for martyn namorong's tour and accompanied him on his visits to sydney and canberra what do our png friends think that this says about the relationship? ______________ australian and new zealand troops have been sent to papua new guinea as the country prepares for volatile general elections. both countries have stated they are merely assisting the elections, but reports from post moresby suggest they are preparing in the event of a breakdown in social order. \"australian troops are holed up in hotels around port moresby airport,\" denis reinhardt a former adviser to the papua new guinea (png) government, said in an email. \"in any emergency, the two sites, which would be secured in pom (port moresby) would be the australian high commission and jacksons airport, for evacuations.\" reinhardt says troops are already there and while he is receiving reports from moresby that it is presently calm, he warns that it may not remain so. \"there will be sustained and scattered violent events in the lead up to elections,\" he wrote. further warnings were made in a report from sydney think tank, the lowy institute. they credit high \"financial bounty\" from png's rich resource sector, the \"enhanced value of political office,\" and a \"proliferation of weapons,\" as well as increased pressure on security forces as factors that have increased the likelihood of violence. \n",

            "02 october 2011 10:46 pm why the history books will have to put an asterisk beside the carter-less cup dan carter, the man who was seemingly put on this earth to end the all blacks' 24-year world cup curse, has been ruled out of the tournament with a groin tear. the people of new zealand have taken the news like a kick to the same place. carter collapsed in a freak training accident on saturday. when he fell to the ground in agony, team-mates looked on nervously and the team doctor looked bewildered. the 29-year-old fly-half has no history of groin problems and was doing his usual kicking practice when he tore his adductor longus tendon. what does this mean for the tournament? in a sense it is worse-case scenario. the poster boy is gone, the king has left the building. everywhere you turn in new zealand you are greeted by carter's chiselled grin. he is on tv adverts, drinks bottles, billboards, magazines, coffee cups. fly-half colin slade can never fill those boots, despite a perfectly competent performance against canada yesterday. carter is the central cog in the slick all black machine; the flashy sidekick to general richie mccaw; the man who can play at a million miles per hour yet break sweat as seldom as roger federer; the 5ft 10in giant whose shoulders never slumped under burden of delivering at the home world cup. he is the best player in the world in the best team in the world, the kind of player who could put the kettle on in the middle of a dump tackle. he is also still improving. so much is made of his attacking prowess, but his defence has stepped up another gear this season. he scythes down big ball carriers who dare enter his no 10 channel, creating the platform for chief poacher mccaw to steal the ball. it is one reason the captain is so effective at the breakdown. he is a nice bloke too, the goody-two-shoes to quade cooper's arch-villain. not unlike jonny wilkinson, he always has time for fans, staying longer than necessary at autograph signings. all black coach graham henry held a dignified press conference yesterday confronted by a hysterical reaction from the kiwi public. 'he??s been a world-class player for a long time, probably one of the greatest players ever produced by this country,' said henry. 'this was going to be his pinnacle, the rugby world cup. we??ve had a lot of focus on this tournament for the last couple of years and it??s devastating he can??t be involved in that. 'it??s a tragic situation for a highly talented young sportsman. this was his scene really; a world cup in new zealand and it was going to be his big occasion.' even if the all blacks win this tournament they won't have their hollywood ending. new zealand has lost its leading man. comments you can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post. post a comment comments are moderated, and will not appear on this weblog until the moderator has approved them. they must not exceed 500 words. web links cannot be accepted, and may mean your whole comment is not published. \n",
            "02 october 2012 4:28 pm one nation ed has made off with cameron's clothes by tim shipman ed miliband has just pulled off something that few politicians achieve. he has cheered his party faithful, rewritten the conventional wisdom about himself and, i suspect, sent a tiny frisson of fear rippling through downing street. by seeking to brand his party as one nation labour, he has stolen a tory title of which david cameron sees himself as the inheritor and sought to reposition the once union-shackled red ed of 2010 in the centre ground of british politics. it was not a perfect speech, none is. remarkably, for a speech delivered without notes, it was too long by a good 10 minutes. it was utterly vacuous in terms of policy detail and mr miliband still refuses to accept that labour spent like drunken sailors in the good times. but if politicians are allowed one big picture speech shorn of policy per term, the conference 3 years before an election is the best time to do it. mr miliband's references to his secular faith, that everyone should be jolly nice to each other and make everything better, were among the most cloying and banal sections of any speech i have ever heard. there were also too many lazy, cheap applause lines like getting the audience to boo michael gove, an education secretary whose flagship policy has been to put rocket boosters under the schools reforms of tony blair and andrew adonis. but mr miliband has shown that he has the guts to deliver a speech without notes and the brain to memorise it. in that he has matched david cameron. he has shown a modicum of geeky charm, riffing on his son daniel's desire for 'dinosaurs' in the speech (tragically, a missed opportunity for a good gag at the expense of union barons). the labour leader also tried a bit of 'i told you so' referencing his lines about producers and predators from last year's disastrously delivered pol-sci lecture. 'one year on people know what i was talking about,' he said. they sure as hell had no idea a year ago. but it is a measure of mr miliband's improvement that the problems with speech were what he left out (lack of guts on the economy and a lack of the big idea). last year the problem was largely with what he included. most importantly, he managed to ram home the most damaging accusation against the tories, that they are a bunch of incompetent, pleb-denouncing public school rapscallions in a way that is memorable. by wrapping himself in the mantra of 'one nation' (a phrase you will now see in every speech and press release the labour party issues), a man who usually takes 22 long words to say anything has dramatised the alleged difference between the two main parties in two words. and he has used a tory slogan, appropriated from david cameron's heroes benjamin disraeli and harold macmillan, to do it. that is the measure of a successful speech and it will get them thinking in no 10. it is as if the pm went off for a spot of skinny dipping and returned to the beach to find mr miliband wearing his vilebrequins. in short it was the best conference speech by a labour leader since tony blair's barnstorming valedictory in 2006 and the most politically significant since blair's backs-against-the-wall effort in the midst of the iraq quagmire and brown's serial disloyalty in 2004. david miliband left the conference this morning to avoid 'overshadowing' his brother. a year ago when ed miliband's leadership was on the line this was a sensible move. now it looks arrogant in its irrelevance. if the embittered elder brother did watch the speech, he will have been weeping over the cv he is presumably now writing. ed miliband has not won the general election. his ideas are often banal, his policies, where they exist, are often ill thought out. but he will be listened to more closely now. the british public may not yet believe that a labour party still in hock to the unions and in denial about its economic mismanagement can build one nation. \"why, i say, that to tax the community for the advantage of a class is not protection; it is plunder, and i entirely disclaim it.\" ed is responsible for the climate change act, which, it's estimated, will cost upwards of a200 billion over next few decades. that cost will be paid for by ordinary voters who, through their energy bills are subsidising those that can afford solar panels as well as companies in the renewables industry making fat profits from such subsidies. milliband is a hypocrite and opportunist of the worst kind, especially since the poorest in society (labour supporters) will have to pay proportionately more for their energy. you political hacks are way too close to this. this speech appealed only to labour's faithful. it won't change a single voter's mind, not least because they won't have watched it and they won't watch the highlights later either. em's electability begins and ends with whether labour is trusted on the economy. if the tories preside over an improving economy and have scope for two rounds of tax cuts before 2015, miliband and labour are toast. post a comment comments are moderated, and will not appear on this weblog until the moderator has approved them. they must not exceed 500 words. web links cannot be accepted, and may mean your whole comment is not published. \n",
            "03/10/2012 the bun mobile there is a lot of buzz around the bun mobile -- wherever i look, there is a new review or someone posting a photo on facebook. i wondered if it's because the buns are really that good, or simply because it's the first food truck in brisbane... i tried for a long time to track down the truck, but either the location was inconvenient for me or the time. and then one saturday i saw a tweet \"we are at king george square for lunch\" and that meant only one for me: it's time to try some buns! in the middle of a really hot day i dragged mu husband down there with me. we picked two buns: one special, which on that day was korean miso glazed chicken, chilli, coriander, mint, sprout salad with wasabi mayo and fried shallots and the regular chicken bun. it wasn't even 5 minutes when i heard my name and the buns were handed to me. what should we do now? -- after a quick look around it was quite obvious, there was not enough shaded places there, so we could stay in a sun and eat quickly or go home, relax and eat there. decision was easy, and the good news was when we arrived in our place, the buns were still warm. although i'm not sure if the journey king george sq -- home was the reason, but when i removed buns from the carton packaging, they were a bit soggy at the bottom and very sticky at the top. the regular chicken bun ($8), was tasty, but the sweetness of a bun itself didn't work that well for me with all the sauces and the chicken. the daily special ($10) was much better. really fresh and crunchy salad and delicious chicken. the only thing that i'm not so sure about was way to much coriander, it overpowered all other flavours. overall it was a pleasant experience, but not something i would go for from the other side of the city. i'm not becoming a big fan, but also am not saying \"never again\". i'll stay neutral and give them a second chance if our paths cross again. \n"

Harlem Renaissance After the American civil war, liberated African-Americans searched for a safe place to explore their new identities as free men and women. They found it in Harlem. Read on to find out how this New York neighborhood became home to some of the best and brightest minds of the   th century, gave birth to a cultural revolution, and earned its status as \"the capital of black America.\" The Great Migration The end of the American Civil War in      ushered in an era of increased education and employment opportunities for black Americans. This created the first black middle class in America, and its members began expecting the same lifestyle afforded to white Americans. But in     , racial equality was delivered a crushing blow when the Plessy v. Ferguson Supreme Court case declared racial segregation to be constitutionally acceptable. This created even harsher conditions for African-Americans, particularly in some Southern states that sought to minimize the equality that former slaves and their descendants might aspire toward. The South also became gradually more and more economically depressed as boll weevils began to infest cotton crops. This reduced the amount of labor needed in the South. As a result, blacks began to head to the Northern United States by the millions. Racism, while still a serious obstacle, was considered much less brutal there than in the South. In addition, the North granted all adult men with the right to vote; provided better educational advancement for African-Americans and their children; and offered greater job opportunities as a result of World War I and the industrial revolution. This phenomenon, known as the Great Migration, brought more than seven million African-Americans to the North. Harlem: The Black Mecca Housing executives planned to create neighborhoods in Harlem designed specifically for white workers who wanted to commute into the city. Developers grew overambitious, however, and housing grew more rapidly than the transportation necessary to bring residents into the downtown area. The once exclusive district was abandoned by the white middle-class, and frustrated developers were forced to cope with lower purchase prices than they first anticipated. White Harlem landlords started selling their properties to black real estate agents such as Philip A. Payton, John E. Nail, and Henry C. Parker. They also began renting directly to black tenants. Meanwhile, the re-development and gentrification of midtown pushed many blacks out of the Metropolitan area. As a result, African-Americans began moving to Harlem en masse; between      and      the number of blacks in the New York City neighborhood doubled. By the time the planned subway system and roadways reached Harlem, many of the country's best and brightest black advocates, artists, entrepreneurs, and intellectuals had situated themselves in Harlem. They brought with them not only the institutions and businesses necessary to support themselves, but a vast array of talents and ambitions. The area soon became known as \"the Black Mecca\" and \"the capital of black America.\" The Harlem Renaissance During the early     s, the burgeoning African-American middle class began pushing a new political agenda that advocated racial equality. The epicenter of this movement was in New York, where three of the largest civil rights groups established their headquarters. Black historian, sociologist, and Harvard scholar, W. E. B. Du Bois was at the forefront of the civil rights movement at this time. In      Du Bois, in collaboration with a group of prominent African-American political activists and white civil rights workers, met in New York to discuss the challenges facing the black community. In     , the group founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), to promote civil rights and fight African-American disenfranchisement. At this same time, the Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey began his promotion of the \"Back to Africa movement.\" Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL), which advocated the reuniting of all people of African ancestry into one community with one absolute government. The movement not only encouraged African-Americans to come together, but to also feel pride in their heritage and race. The National Urban League (NUL) also came into being in the early   th century. Founded by Ruth Standish Baldwin and Dr. George Edmund Haynes, the fledgling organization counseled black migrants from the South, trained black social workers, and worked to give educational and employment opportunities to blacks. Together, these groups helped to establish a sense of community and empowerment for African-Americans not only in New York, but also around the country. In addition, they provided a rare opportunity for whites to collaborate with black intellectuals, social activists, educators, and artists in an attempt to transform a largely segregated and racist American society. Instead of using more direct political means to achieve their goals, African-American civil rights activists employed the artists and writers of their culture to work for the goals of civil rights and equality. Jazz music, African-American fine art, and black literature were all absorbed into mainstream culture, bringing attention to a previously disenfranchised segment of the American population. This blossoming of African-American culture in European-American society, particularly in the worlds of art and music, became known as The Harlem Renaissance. Culture Comes Together One of the first notable events of the Renaissance came shortly after the NUL began publishing Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life. Believing that art and literature could lift African-Americans out of their situation, the magazine's editor, Charles S. Johnson, began printing promising black writers in each issue. During Johnson's work for Opportunity, he met Jessie Fauset , the literary editor for Du Bois' NAACP magazine, Crisis. Fauset told Johnson about her first novel, There Is Confusion (    ), a story about middle class black women. In     , Johnson organized the first Civic Club dinner, which was planned as a release party for Fauset's book. The party was an instant success, and served as a forum for emerging African-American artists to meet wealthy white patrons. The party managed to launch the careers of several promising black writers, including poets Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen . In     , shortly after the success of the Civic Club dinner, the magazine Survey Graphic, produced an issue on Harlem. Edited by black philosopher and Howard University professor, Alain Locke , the magazine featured work by prominent black writers of the time period. The magazine published work by writers Cullen, Hughes and Fauset, as well as poet Claude McKay and novelist Jean Toomer . Later that year, Locke expanded the special issue into an anthology called The New Negro. The collection fueled America's growing interest in African-American writers, pushing black artists to the literary forefront. African-American fine artists such as Aaron Douglas and Charles Alston also got their start through Alain Locke and Charles Johnson, who started publishing the artists' works as illustrations and cover art. Pulled into the spotlight, these fine artists used their fame as an opportunity to delve into the themes they found problematic to American culture. By introducing the \"exoticizing\" of Africa and notions of \"the primitive\" to white America, African-American artists had their first opportunity to explore how these ideas could be used for and against their race. The Jazz Age With the conclusion of WWI came an end to wartime frugality and conservation. In an era of peace, Americans experienced an economic boom, as well as a change in social morays. Nicknamed \"The Roaring   s\" for its dynamic changes, the decade became known for its celebration of excess and its rejection of wartime ideologies. Americans also began investing more time and money in leisure activities and artistic endeavors. Around this same time, Congress ratified the Prohibition Act. While the amendment did not ban the actual consumption of alcohol, it made obtaining it legally difficult. Liquor-serving nightclubs, called \"speakeasies\" developed during this time as a way to allow Americans to socialize, indulge in alcohol consumption, and rebel against the traditional culture. One of the best speakeasies in Harlem was the Cotton Club, a place that intended to have the look and feel of a luxurious Southern plantation. To complete the theme, only African-American entertainers could perform there, while only white clientele (with few exceptions) were allowed to patronize the establishment. This attracted high-powered celebrity visitors such as Cole Porter , Bing Crosby and Doris Duke to see the most talented black entertainers of the day. Some of the most famous jazz performers of the time - including singer Lena Horne , composer and musician Duke Ellington , and singer Cab Calloway - graced the Cotton Club stage. Attending clubs in Harlem allowed whites from New York and its surrounding areas to indulge in two taboos simultaneously: to drink, as well as mingle with blacks. Jazz musicians often performed in these clubs, exposing white clientele to what was typically an African-American form of musical entertainment. As jazz hit the mainstream, many members of older generations began associating the raucous behavior of young people of the decade with jazz music. They started referring to the   s, along with its new dance styles and racy fashions, as \"The Jazz Age.\" The End of the Renaissance As the   s came to a close, so did white America's infatuation with Harlem- and the artistic and intellectual movements surrounding it. The advent of The Great Depression also crushed the wild enthusiasm of \"The Roaring   s,\" bringing an end to the decadence and indulgence that fueled the patronage of Harlem artists and their establishments. The depression hit the African-American segment of the population hard; layoffs and housing foreclosures shut many blacks out of the American Dream that previously seemed so close at hand. The increased economic tension of the Depression caused black leaders to shift their focus from arts and culture to the financial and social issues of the time. In addition, the strained relationship between the black community and the white shop-owners in Harlem finally tore the two groups apart in     . That alienation was expressed in the Harlem Riot of     , the nation's first modem race riot. The resulting violence finally shattered the notion of Harlem as the \"Mecca\" for African-Americans, and broke the fleeting truce between white and black America. While the Renaissance as a historical movement was over, the effects it had on modern society were far from finished. The artistic and political movements of the   s would live on in American culture in the form of new musical expression, award-winning writing and, most importantly, the civil rights movement of the   s and   s. These events, and the role Harlem would continue to play after the Renaissance, would change the American cultural landscape forever. \n",

This business should be shut down.The customer service is terrible and they stole $    from me. I had a large tattoo that I was going to do in   session. I started it in March of      and circumstances prevented me from coming back until recently. Also,I was leary of going back to get it finished because it healed terribly. When I called to tell them that they would have to touch it up, Robert blamed me for not healing it properly,even though I have   other tattoos that all healed fine. When I called in Feb to schedule the final session, Robert claimed that the work they already did was $    worth of tattooing. LIES! So I went in with my friend who is a tattoo artist, he and immediatlely insulted her and told me to leave. I have since been calling at least once a week and he keeps screwing me over by telling me I have to talk to the artist, then never putting the artist on the phone. I finally got ahold of the artist, and he claims the same thing...the he never told me he would do the tattoo in   sessions, and the work he did was it. He continued to be a jerk to me on the phone, so I called him a liar and hung up. \n",

            "   ?This is a case series of six patients who presented with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. The aim is to understand these clinicoradiological features of PRES and its management Abstract These are case series with six patients who presented with Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome related to severe hypertension due to various causes managed by neurology team based in DGH & Tertiary neurosciences centre. This series shows the diversity of its presentation and quick recognisation and management would help in reversing the damage but there are situation were controlling hypertension becomes difficult due to nature of the aetiology of the hypertension as a result this could lead to non reversible damages. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome also called as PRES is a clinico radiological syndrome with severe hypertension, altered sensorium, seizures, visual symptoms and MRI features of changes involving predominantly the occipitopareital areas, cerebellum, BS. Prompt treatment with antihypertensive to bring down the blood pressure had been effective in reversing the damage. Understanding the tolerability and the safe practice in management of hypertension and possible adverse effects due to difficulties in controlling blood pressure with various comorbidity is very important. At present commonly used protocols are Labetalol or Glyceryl tri nitrate infusion and maintenance with single or combination therapy. Most of the critical care physicians worldwide favour labetalol and sodium nitroprusside with caution. What ever antihypertensive agents we use the evidences suggest to concentrate in bringing mean arterial pressure down by   % in first   --  ?h is a reasonably approach. PRES is otherwise a neurological emergency which can present as severe head ache, status epilepticus, posterior circulation infarct, acute visual loss? cause with severe hypertension. \n",
            "    The Time Meddler And so it begins. Gallifrey begins to emerge into the Doctor Who mythos, ready to take it's grand place alongside other significant Who staples. At last the noble race of Time Lords can stand revealed as we learn just where the Doctor came from. Except we don't. Don't worry, we will. Gallifrey, as Rassilon proclaimed not long ago, will rise. But The Time Meddler is more akin to a sneak peek and the Monk a rather less than sterling example of Gallifrey's finest. But I'm getting ahead of myself. We open on a rather sinister looking clock ticking away. It's obviously an attempt at foreshadowing, but it just doesn't quite work for me. It puts me more in mind of the opening of Back to the Future. What is effective is the shot of the Doctor standing over the TARDIS controls as if he's just left Bad Wolf Bay, even without knowing what has gone before you can tell just looking at William Hartnell that he's suffered some kind of loss. Vicki is kind enough to bring us up to speed by discussing the recent departure of Ian and Barbara. It's quite easy to dismiss the importance of this event nearly half a century later, but their departure left Hartnell as the only remaining cast member from the opening episode. In a moment that sadly doesn't seem to have set a precedent the Doctor freely admits to being saddened by their departure. This isn't yet the gallivanting alien who picks up and deposits passengers like a interdimensional taxi driver, this is a man who is hurt enough by his abandonment to let it show and it's quite disconcerting. \"We may land in their time one day and be able to discuss old times.\" We know they won't. Even once the Doctor finally learns to fly the TARDIS we know that he seldom revisits old friendships outside of Sarah Jane and the Brig, but it leaves the door open nicely for Ian and Barbara to return and for the audience to not feel they're gone forever. As luck would have it just as Vicki and the Doctor are bemoaning their lack of company they hear what they presume to be a Dalek wondering round the TARDIS. It turns out instead to be Steven Taylor, played by Peter Purves  (yes him from Crufts) rather than Jack Davenport. Whist Steven recovers with his cuddly panda (I'm not joking) the TARDIS materialises on a beach, observed by a lone monk.  He seems intrigued about the TARDIS, but not overly shocked. Almost as if he knows more than he should. The first time I saw The Time Meddler I was genuinely intrigued about the monk, after all the Internet had yet to spoil most of the series for me. I'd imagine that most of you reading this review know fine well that the monk is in fact a Time Lord? No? Ah. Spoilers. Should have said. In the TARDIS Steven is being given a guided tour of his new home. The highlights for me include the horizontal control and \"a chair with a panda on it.\" The tour concludes with the Doctor making a request of the new companion: \"Please stop buggering me.\" Meanwhile, back in the TARDIS Steven is being given a guided tour of his new home. The highlights for me include the horizontal control and \"a chair with a panda on it.\" The tour concludes with the Doctor making a request of the new companion. \"Please stop buggering me.\" It's safe to presume from Vicki's face that this wasn't the intended line, however I can state with absolute certainty that whatever was initially scripted wasn't nearly as amusing. Steven's disbelief is somewhat refreshing. No polite disbelief or incredulous looks for him. As far as he's concerned this old man is off his rocker, but he takes it in good humour and continues to gently mock the Doctor for the rest of the episode. Indeed his mock interrogation of the Doctor's story leads to details of the craft being given within ear shot of the Monk's hearing. It's at this point I had to remind myself that this was made in the   s. It's early days for the show's mythos and there is absolutely no reason that the Doctor should be able to sense the Monk just because he could sense the Master in his Tenth body. We're reminded, quite forcibly, that a lot of the show's continuity was cobbled together as it went along and that there was just no way the writers could anticipate their scripts having to conform to rules that wouldn't exist as we know them for decades to come. But I digress. As night falls on our crew it casts an eerie shadow over proceedings, that is until you hear the wildlife sounds cranked up just a little too much. I'm still trying to decide if it was a plot point or not. The night shots are beautifully realised. Just as well really as the sun sets in this serial more times than it would in a Michael Bay film. Still, it looks the part. The Doctor informs the fourth wall that he misses having a History Teacher as a companion. He's not alone, not if it means we're spared such painful conversations. After wandering off from his companions the Doctor tries to casually ascertain the year from a local stopping just short of asking what the year actually is. He later informs the fourth wall that he misses having a History Teacher as a companion. He's not alone, not if it means we're spared such painful conversations. The monks chanting that the Doctor then overhears sounds suspiciously like a bad recording. So much so that when the chanting speed suddenly varies like a tape being chewed it takes me a few moments to realise that it's a plot point rather than a prop failure (although curiously the chanting is revealed as originating on a gramophone player. Possibly high technology at the time of broadcast, being a child of the late   s I can only guess, but it certainly isn't a tape!) The first episode ends with the Doctor being trapped by the Monk. We'll skip the second episode entirely as it feels very much like filler, probably due to the absence of the Doctor for the duration of it. When we finally catch up with him, the Doctor is casually discussing his escape with a local. Given his later fear and disdain of his fellow Time Lords he seems remarkably unconcerned about the Monk. Continuity tinted glasses again I guess. These same glasses muddy the waters somewhat when it comes to judging the Monk. On one hand he's seen healing the wounded and sick with penicillin, something quite Doctor-like, and then we see him consulting his eight point plan for villainy. Seriously. He has an actual plan on a pull down chart. 'Position Atomic Canon' followed by 'Sight Vikings' gives you an idea of just how well thought out his plan is. But the Monk isn't the highlight of this episode, it's the Doctor himself. The time off seems to have worked wonders for Hartnell and he returns in sparkling form and seems to relish taking on the Monk. A shame then that the Monk fails to live up to any kind of challenge. Having said that, their dialogue in the last episode gives us our first glimpse of where these Time Lords have come from. \"You know as well as I do the golden rule about space and time travelling\" \"Never, never interfere with the course of history.\" \"Who says so?\" Asks the Monk and the thought occurs that his dialogue wouldn't be out of place spoken by the Fourth Doctor and to prove the point he finishes with \"It's more fun my way.\" As the Monk rattles off his list of achievements to date you can't help but agree with him.  Then when he mentions his hand in building Stonehenge you begin to wonder just who it was that built the Pandorica for the Alliance. Continuity Tinted Glasses again and if you watch this episode wearing them then you can't help but be struck by the sheer hypocrisy of the Doctor. Throughout this story the Doctor acts more like the Time Lords he's running from rather than the free spirit he's set to become, but when you consider that he only seems to be fifty years away from Gallifrey according to the Monk then it's really not that surprising he's still holding on to some of the basic tenets that he was raised with. His final solution of trapping the Monk on earth without a functioning TARDIS actually works better with the continuity glasses as it eerily foreshadows the Pertwee era. Speaking of the Monk's TARDIS, it's reveal at the end of Episode   must have been truly staggering at it's first showing. No-one knew anything of where the Doctor came from and to discover one of his own kind half way through an historical must have been staggering for the audience of the time. Ultimately The Time Meddler works best for what it implies rather than what it shows. The Monk isn't anything close to a match for the Doctor despite superior equipment and could never be the Master in my mind, regardless of what some fan theories have suggested. However through his dialogue with the Doctor we learn an awful lot about where they came from and just who the Doctor might have been before we met him. And this wouldn't be the last time we met a Time Lord. Indeed, we might even meet this particular Time Lord again... I'll leave you with the highlight for me though; an exchange between Vicki and Steven discussing the implications of meddling with time. \"Memories will change\" we're told. It's an explanation for every continuity error made during the fifty year run given, for all intents and purposes, at the very start of the run. Yet people still get upset when some things don't match up perfectly between episodes. About the author Alasdair Shaw dabbled in Who throughout the   s, but didn't really get into it properly until     . His sense of timing has not improved over the years. He's a third generation Who fan as well as a father of two. His wife has a bad feeling about those two facts. When not working as a lab technician or writing for Kasterborous Alasdair runs the Doctor Who Reprint Society for which he writes In Print and Dangling Threads. He's a big fan of the Valeyard, but that's neither here nor there. He has never worked for UNIT and is not related to Dr Liz Shaw. we were so excited when we saw the inside of the monk's Tardis. It's difficult to explain how magical the Tardis control room was. It was the santuary, the place of safety that could be maddeningly out of reach. That is why the cliff hanger in the Web planet where the Tardis was apparently lost worked so well for us \"...there is absolutely no reason that the Doctor should be able to sense the Monk just because he could sense the Master in his Tenth body\" -- maybe the Dr/other Time Lords can only sense the presence of high-ranking Time Lords; perhaps the Monk just doesn't cut it? Interestingly, the Dr later senses the presence of the presumed-dead Morbius, when he's being drugged via the glass of wine at Solon's castle. I enjoyed reading this, AS, though I think you mean 'basic tenets he was raised with' rather than 'tenants'; but I like the idea of the Monk growing up with flatmates! I remember at the time I first saw this in the early     ?s on BBC  thinking the implied rape of Edith was totally unsuitable for a children's programme and totlaly out of the keep of the rest of the story. I still think that, but as Edith seems to get over it very quickly I will too! I was really impressed with the cliffhanger for part three though and Peter Butterworth is really good throughout the story. I loved the Target novelizations of the Hartnell stories in the eighties, but being too young to have watched the stories on TV I had to imagine what those years looked like. (Which was the magic of those books. They made us create our own vision of Doctor Who, and this demand on my imagination got me even more hooked on the show). But until I recently sat down and carefully watched every Hartnell adventure, I hadn't appreciated just how good Peter Purves was. Right from the start, he was a reliable foil for the Doctor, and he gives The Time Meddler a solid, human core. His anger at the end of The Massacre is the most believable dramatic moment of the Hartnell years. I'd have loved to see him hang around longer to be a straight man to Troughton. The Monk could have been the Master, but of course it was never intended. I like to think that the Monk was Hartnell's functional equivalent of the Master. Except like many Doctor Who concepts (such as the Doctor at the time) he was unfinished and very much prototypical, unlike Troughton's War Chief (If you've ever seen the War Games you'll know what i mean). The same   ?s Master that was in the King's Demons you mean? A basic rehash of the same story you just reviewed? C'mon, even the Monk would facepalm the Master's sloppy execution in that story. I can't see why you'd be baffled by the idea that someone would like to use their imagination, so what if someone likes the idea that the Monk was the Master? It's not a crime. I simply expressed both the Monk and the War Chief's functional equivalency to the Master, I could go as far as to say Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty's relationship was functionally similar to the Third Doctor and the Master, as was intended by the production team. Doesn't mean i think they are all the same character. I was going by your opening comment; \"The Monk could of been the Master\". I'm all for linking continuities and histories together, as long as there is some logic and substance presented with the argument. Apart from being Time Lords that the Doctor has fought I can't see a single connection. I've not seen The King's Demons, but a quick glance through a synopsis reveals the Master's plan to be a little more thought out than the Monk's one. That's the beauty of it, a connection or a pattern is always in the eye of the beholder. But from a production point of view, they'll always be seperate characters, unless some future producer decides to highlight the issue. As for King's Demons, well i guess you'll just have to give it a spin. One of the Master's best wigs, and possibly his worst plan yet. Still fun to watch though What is interesting is that at the end of Episode    of The Daleks master Plan The Doctor strands The Monk on an ice planet and The Monk's last ever words(if we accept your reasoning) are \"I'll get you for this Doctor! I'll get you one day!\" In \"Terror of the Autons\" (The Master's supposed \"first\" appearance) a Time Lord comes to warn The Doctor that \"an old acquaintance has arrived on this planet\" and that he \"has learnt a great deal since you last met him\". The original script also noted that \"The Master\" was a new alias, and that the Doctor had ruined one of \"The Master\"'s schemes, and that \"The Master\" was out for revenge. The Doctor is unimpressed \"That jackanapes! All hes does is cause trouble!\" he states and later \"I refuse to be worried by a renegade like The Master. He's a, he's an unimaginative plodder.\" It is only when he sees that \"The Master\" has indeed learnt a great deal since they last met that he takes the threat seriously. And we know that when they last met The Master could not have been in his Delgado incarnation when The Doctor fails to recognise the voice on the telephone. Then there's the fact that The Monk was always going on about his \"master plan\". Or the fact that the Time lord specifically states that The Master scored higher marks in science than The Doctor. The Monk was able to fix his faulty chameleon circuit(which The Doctor never did), and escape from      in a TARDIS with a shrunken interior. It makes no sense he would never come after The Doctor again. And where was The Doctor's prior(to Autons) meeting with The Master? The Master of Logopolis is reckless like The Monk. And Doctor Who Magazine ran an article shortly before the aforementioned King's Demons stating that it would feature the return of a villain first seen in The Time Meddler. Quite frankly, the idea that The Monk ISN'T The Master is what I find bizarre. \n",

            "   November      The writers of our songs are the true national leaders \"Let me write the songs of a nation: I don't care who writes the laws\" - Andrew Fletcher, Scottish politician WHEN HE FIRST TOOK OFFICE I used to hear news about Governor Powes Parkop's vision to clean the city and the people's mindsets by the year     . With that year coming to an end now, how have we fared? Have we changed? Parkop posed the question to a workshop of certain middle level bureaucrats, \"How do we get people to change their mindsets and attitudes?\" Indeed: \"How?\" Mindsets and attitudes cannot be legislated or regulated into being. They exist free of the external things we set up to control society. Conscience is the freest component of a human person. Inserted and guaranteed by God Himself. I could even say that the freedom of conscience is a freedom more precious than liberty itself. Throughout history and even today people have sacrificed their physical freedom and even their lives to keep their consciences free. And the most powerful of people have been those who have been able to permeate people's conscience. Leadership, I heard from Myles Munroe, is the ability to influence human behaviour. Human behaviour is a product of the human conscience. Leadership is therefore the ability to influence the human conscience to such an extent as it affects human behaviour. All these matters considered, I have concluded who the real leaders of this nation are. They are not the prime ministers, the members of parliament or the nation's top bureaucrats. They are not the ones who possess power or control over vast amounts of money or land or people. They are not those who have many wives and massive wealth; or who drive successful businesses and expensive vehicles. For me, the true leaders are smaller people. They probably live with relatives because they can't afford rentals. Maybe they make their homes in settlements. They possibly have small blue-collar jobs that they struggle through every day. But they are famous people. Known and loved by many who share the same everyday experiences they do. They are the local songwriters, singers, poets, writers and the storytellers. But I'll focus on the songwriters and singers because that segment of the arts has more dominion in PNG than the storytelling, books and poetry. The majority in this nation listens to music and song every day. And songs have the ability to stick and continually play in the minds of people. The words, aided by music, can seep easily into our subconscious, shaping the mindset without us even knowing it. When we constantly listen to the same thing we usually end up believing it -- without even making a conscious decision to start believing. Sooner or later we start living out the kind of beliefs transmitted by the songs. Our behaviour is affected. Human behaviour is shaped by what we constantly hear, see and read -- by what is constantly communicated to us. Politicians can deliver speeches once in a while but their words do not dwell in our minds and hearts as much as songs and music. Hence politicians, despite having the authority to make laws and the macro-decisions for the country, do not have much influence on the people's behaviour. That privilege (or responsibility) lies with our song-writers and singers. The problem, however, is that many popular local songs are full of negative themes such as self-pity and regret, low self-esteem, loss of hope (\"I give up\") etc. They are uninspiring and narrow-minded. They stimulate fleeting desires that can never be satisfied. Those words, and the phrase \"I'm living for the weekend\", reinforce within young people that life has no ultimate meaning or everlasting joy, but if we compound our pleasures every weekend -- by taking alcohol, dancing away and picking up a one-night stand -- we may salvage some happiness. This is a dangerous message. Yet this song is (was) a hit with very young children who had yet to cement a proper outlook of life. Then there's Tania's Trupla Man. I once watched a TV program showcasing Tania promoting that song to hundreds of kids mostly below the age of   . Some kids (possibly aged between   and   ) were called to the stage and sang the chorus brilliantly: \" Trupla man, wokobaut long bikpla nait. Painim mi. Em orait. Mi save long ting ting blong yu !...\" (\"A real man walks in the dead of the night looking for me. That's fine. I know what you're thinking\") I thought to myself, \"What the heck!\" These kids are singing along without a clue as to what Tania's intent was (I doubt Tania herself knew). But very early a mentality is being embedded into their subconscious. It is, if your body desires something, get out there and do what it takes to satisfy your body. And if you do so you are a \" trupla man \" (real man)! Such songs are dangerous to our society. They summon up energies and curiosities within children and young people before they have built strong foundations from which they can properly direct such energy. They lack a message of hope, peace, unity and other positive themes that could energise Papua New Guineans to do the right thing. Yes we do have some of those more uplifting songs ringing through the air, but they're significantly outnumbered by the negative. Songs with such words are not just harmless music and entertainment. They shape human thought. They shape the conscience. They shape culture. If there are songwriters out there reading this, you have more power than you know. Use it well. As for politicians, if you'd like to regain some of your lost power from the singers and songwriters, I recommend you ban the so many negatively-charged songs that infiltrate almost every young heart every single day in Papua New Guinea. If we are to have a positive society with a positive culture we have to change the things that shape the minds that shape the behaviour of the people that shape our society. Comments You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post. Song lyrics are, for the greater part, geared towards entertainment. They reflect a certain frame of mind that the singer feels and wants to relate to the audience. Poetry, the less appreciated root of song lyrics, is more fundamental - poetry searches, poetry questions, poetry plumbs the depths of who we are and what we believe. Problem is most people just don't have the time. You could say that we'd rather be brain-washed through song than asked than meditate on poetry. Hear, hear! You just hit the nail on the head, Ganjiki. This is something I have been bemoaning for a long while now and you articulated it brilliantly for me there. I totally agree with you. However, your recommendation of banning a song may run against the grain of our stance on free speech and freedom of expression. Plus the act of banning almost always increases a creative work's marketability. Something like reverse psychology, if you may. The more viable option perhaps, would be to get this message -- what you just wrote above -- to all our people, and especially our songwriters, producers and recording studios so they can take some affirmative action on this matter. For example, we could have these artists invited to a workshop and through face-to-face and small group sessions, get them to this side of the picture. Make them realise the power they yield with their words in song, and how they can use it to better benefit the community, and in turn contribute to building a better society in Papua New Guinea. This could also provide an avenue for artists to share ideas with each other and with industry professionals on refining their music to break out of the shallow drivel of  -beat mould. I'm sure people like Allen 'AK  ' Kedea and even PNG music giants like Telek (here's me hoping) would be keen to participate in such a productive exercise as well. This collaborative act would blow any other collaborations out of the water. :) While on affirmative action, there's a National Symposium on Arts and Culture coming up next week, and I recall seeing some names from the music fraternity like Pati Doi and Oala Moi in the programme lineup. Guys, this agenda could surely do with some breathing room on the podium. \n",
            "   October      Some Kind of Wonderful progress... Last week I spent the most time working on my monthly cottages project Finished this one... and made a start on the next one. I did get the chance to finish off a couple more blocks for the SKOW quilt. The kitty cat... I enjoyed stitching this and it turned out to be quite easy to needle turn. The next one I made to replace the shoes block in row   as I'm not really a fan of high heels. I am a fan of bees though so I made a beehive with some embroidered buzzy bees... I enjoyed making this one too! Not a lot of sewing time over the weekend. On Saturday Catherine and I went to see the new Resident Evil film which we've been looking forward to for ages. Lots of Alice in action but the story was quite lacking I thought. On the way home we detoured via Abakhan fabrics (it was a detour too as it's in completely the opposite direction) so that I could pick up a few supplies. I didn't actually go to buy fabric but really - what stitcher is going to walk into a fabric shop and not even take a peek at the fabric? I came out with this... because I just couldn't leave without it! I have no idea what to use it for but for now I'm enjoying looking at it :) It was a bit pricey compared with Abakhan's normal fabulous prices but I notice that it's actually made by a New Zealand company so perhaps that's the reason. It's called 'A Stitch in Time' by Nutex. I really like it a lot! \n",
            "              Get rid of duplicate contacts in salesforce.com Well, it's been a busy few weeks here at Foration towers.  I wanted to share with you a recent issue we had with one of our Salesforce.com clients. Our client called in a bit of a panic as they had been trying to setup Salesforce for Outlook when it went horribly wrong and duplicated everyone of the sales director's      contacts.  Not good. They had tried to use Plaxo to remove the duplicates but that had caused issues when re-syncing as   % of the contacts couldn't be removed from Salesforce as they were associated with Cases and other records -- which would have resulted in all sorts of data integrity issues.  Still not good. The only remaining option was to use the built-in merge functionality.  Trouble is, that has to be done through point and clicking and merging      contacts across a few hundred accounts would take over a day! ~   seconds per contact x      contacts =       seconds (   hours) Pretty tedious task and not the best use of anyone's time. To help with this we wrote a Visualforce Page to allow the director to automatically merge the exact duplicates at the click of a button.  This programme then re-scanned all of the contacts in Salesforce for similar matches and gave the director a chance to merge some close duplicates that he was not even aware of! Result: A very happy sales director and the IT chaps look like heroes! Having similar issues?  Get in touch with Paul on               to see how Foration can help you. \n",
            "  .  .   Fernando \"Terremoto\" performing a bulerias in the pea Tio Jos de Paula in Jerez One only had to hear the first few seconds of Fernando Fernandez Pantoja, \"El Terremoto\" (\"the Earthquake\") singing to understand why he got his stage name. I was recently arrived to Jerez and the flamenco scene in      when I heard Terremoto perform at a flamenco pea. Terremoto came from a large a prestigious gypsy family from Jerez, and was the son of the original \"Terremoto\", a flamenco cantaor who died in     , who is still spoken of in the flamenco world with reverence for his tremendous voice and prowess. Even as a flamenco novice I was completely mesmerised by Fernando Terremoto's voice, and was acutely aware that I was in the presence of a master.  He could, in the course of interpreting a flamenco style, make his voice go from the sound of thunder to the merest whisper, sustaining a note with a melisma so common in flamenco style cante but executed perfectly.  There was no question as to whether or not hearing Terremoto's voice would give you goose bumps.  The question was just how many times over. Terremoto, who just a year before I first saw him perform had won first prize for cante in the Biennal de Sevilla , became a regular fixture in the flamenco pea scene in Jerez.  It was particularly gratifying for me when, taking visiting friends to see flamenco for the first time, we were fortunate enough to see him perform, to have his voice as the first flamenco cante they were exposed to.  Even if one did not understand the words, he had a capacity to transmit the deepest sentiments flamenco can produce. One can only lament then, that this artist, at the age of   , today February    succumbed to an illness that began exactly a year ago when his singing career was cut short and he was hospitalised with a brain tumor.  He had a brief period of recovery, performing in September of      in the flamenco pea that bears his name, as well as a performance in said pea in November that I was very fortunate to have attended.  That night, not expecting to, I was once again with the hairs on the back of my neck on end, captivated by his performance.  That night, with the humility of a man who had stared death in the face he thanked profoundly the crowd who had come to see him and who cheered him at every opportunity.  Little did I know that his situation would slowly deteriorate afterwards, leading to the cancellation of his planned performance in the upcoming Jerez Flamenco Festival only a week ago.  Tomorrow, February   , at the Parroqua La Asuncin in Jerez, his funeral will be held at   :  .   Fernando Terremoto- a life cut too short....a flamenco artist from Jerez without peer. \n",
            "   August        :   AM Sorry Wiggo, you are wrong about cycle helmets Bradley Wiggins is a top bloke. He lacks the unappealing narcissism of so many athletes, gives the impression that he has a life away from the saddle and is a Mod to boot. But that doesn??t stop him being (most probably) wrong about cycle helmets. On Wednesday night a cyclist was killed in a collision with an Olympic bus in Stratford. Speaking afterwards, Mr Wiggins said: ??Ultimately, if you get knocked off and you don??t have a helmet on, then you can??t argue,?_ he said. ??You can get killed if you don??t have a helmet on.?_ Well yes, that is unarguably true, but it is equally unarguably true that you can also get killed if you do have a helmet on. And here we enter one of the most vexed and controversial areas in the whole of statistics, the strange science of cycle safety. The whole issue of cycle helmets is so strange that David Spiegelhalter, the very excellent Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University, a man who knows more about accident stats than almost anyone else, half-jokingly refuses to talk about it. ??Cycle helmets?_ he once told me. ??I try not to go there.?_ The problem is that almost everything about cycle safety is counter-intuitive, and a great deal of what we think we know is in fact guesswork. This we do know: in places were the wearing of helmets HAS been made compulsory, such as in some Australian states, cycling appears to become more dangerous and accident rates (and injuries) actually go up. Why? We don??t know. Maybe well-publicised compulsory helmet laws make cycling appear to be more dangerous than it is, discouraging all by the brave (and reckless) from taking to the streets. Thus the number of cyclists may remain the same, but they may be drawn from a slightly different (more accident prone) population. Another, almost opposite explanation also suggests itself. Making people wear helmets may make cycling appear to be SAFER than it really is. This could encourage normally cautious types to take more risks. You see? This is far from straightforward. Finally, anything which makes cycling less appealing (and many people do not like wearing helmets) will reduce cyclist numbers. It may also encourage motorists to take more chances around bikes, as they subconsciously calculate that anyone on two-wheels is ??protected??. We know other things. The safest places to ride a bike are places where the most bikes are ridden. You are far, far less likely to be killed on a bicycle on the streets of Amsterdam or Copenhagen than you are in New York or Los Angeles. The safest places to ride a bike are also places were almost no one wears a helmet at all. I don??t think I have ever seen a Dutchman or woman wearing head protection, and the Netherlands?? road safety record is excellent, (matching ours, in fact, as the best in the world, although it is a better place to ride a bike). More cyclists equals fewer accidents. Several possible reasons for this. There??s the ??critical mass?? theory that says simply that as bikes become commonplace motorists learn to give them more space and treat them as equals. Perhaps more importantly, in a rich country where almost everyone rides a bike (such as Denmark) many, if not most, of these cyclists will also drive cars. The safest drivers where cyclists are concerned are also (probably) cyclists themselves. But of course the direction of the causal arrow is not entirely clear. It may be that places with safe roads, proper provision for cyclists (especially dedicated cycle lanes) simply encourage more people to cycle. It??s probably a bit of both. More statistical oddities: women, although generally less reckless on the road, are slightly more likely to come to grief on a bike. Not because they are ??worse?? cyclists but in fact because they are better. There is some evidence (the Department for Transport has some stats on this that it tried to bury a few years ago) which suggested that highly ??law abiding?? cyclists were more likely to be killed, particularly by commercial vehicles at junctions. This is because when push comes to shove, a cyclist is very often better off ??jumping?? a red light by a few seconds to avoid being crushed by a truck??s nearside turning left (a major cause of cycle accidents). I don??t know whether wearing a cycle helmet makes it less likely that you will die on the roads or not. I suspect the latter but I wear one anyway, when I remember. I strongly suspect (although again I do not know for sure, because no one does) that making helmet-wearing compulsory will not help and will probably make things worse. I know more bikes on the road makes those bikes safer (as well as reducing traffic congestion, pollution, and so on). I know that the risks FROM cyclists are so minute to be irrelevant; a handful of pedestrians are killed or seriously injured by bikes every year compared to the hundreds of cyclists and pedestrians killed by cars and (especially) trucks and buses. I know that probably the single best way of encouraging more people to cycle would be the provision of proper, dedicated cycle lanes. London Mayor Boris Johnson is a keen cyclist and must be commended for raising the profile of cycling in London but his big blue cycle lanes are for the most part merely markings on the road, not lanes where cyclists are safe from being mown down by vehicles a hundred times their weight travelling at twice their speed. Cycle lanes work but they are expensive and councils see to put them at the bottom of their priority lists. Finally, we can surely do something about the infestation of heavy goods vehicles in our cities. I do not fully understand why the streets of London are clogged by massive   -wheelers whereas the streets of Paris or Vienna are not. Bradley Wiggins is (probably) wrong about cycle helmets (his comments on not listening toiPOds and using lights at night were bang on the money) but by giving cycling such a high profile he may be doing a great deal for cycle safety anyway, by encouraging a new generation of youngsters to take to the roads on two wheels.

Trust in ourselves is sadly not all that's to it. A lot of accidents can happy by other road users. Not having an airbag is not at all safe! Why? because you can be the safest driver in the world but it doesn't stop another driving smashing into the back of you causing your head to smash though the wind screen!!!!!! We need a more active nation, all fair and well Boris bringing out his bikes but where's the safety!? What an awful article the Mail has produced. How can one person say wearing a helmet can hinder people. I've seen comments taking into account of the shape of helmets and other risk facts. But this writer hasn't really made any valid points at all! \"Making people wear helmets may make cycling appear to be SAFER than it really is. This could encourage normally cautious types to take more risks\" Yes well done cycling appears safer when wearing a helmet. Why? because that person is wearing a hard shell around their head that protects their skull from crushing if it hits the ground fast. Surely wearing a helmet would never make a person less/more weary? Perhaps wearing a helmet would make the person feel comfortable but what studies / experiments do you have about people not looking because they're so preoccupied about having something on their head!? Bottom line is if children are reading this. Helmets are incredibly cool! Lots of people's lives could have been saved if these people wore a helmet during their accident. Please consider this article as another one of the Mail's failed attempt at journalism. If helmets with sticky out bits make people weary consider the 'bmx helmet' smooth round basic matte helmet, very cool and very trust worthy! I think debating whether helmets are effective and debating whether helmets should be made compulsory are two different topics. For a safety measure to be made compulsory it has to be practically enforceable. Forcing and policing cyclists to wear helmets is not as such. Bicycles do not come equipped with helmets that fit everyone providing the minimum level of protection, and they are not practical for the majority of the population. Regular cyclists are not what we are talking about here. We are talking about people who decide to occasionally ride a bike, just like people occasionally decide to ride the London Underground or a train or a bus or a taxi with children. Think of the Cycle hire scheme for example as a form of public transport. In those cases, exemptions are made so that the general public find such transport systems convenient. When we talk about personal transport, a cyclist must be able to carry the helmet in such a way that its integrity is not compromised. This is very impractical at the moment. Let's take some examples from real life: seat belts come fitted to all cars, you don't need to carry your own seatbelt with you at all times. On the other hand, if you travel with kids and need to take a taxi, you won't be required to have a child seat. So, helmets might be the most effective way to protect from head injuries for cyclists, but due to infrequent nature of such accidents, the general consensus is that if you find yourself in a situation with higher risk for head injuries, you should be responsible for your own safety because the cost of policing that *everyone* wears one is not required. I personally wear a helmet when I figure the risk of head injuries is higher. But yes, it is left to the individual just like the choice of the type of helmet, and the choice of wearing hi-viz or wearing a spine protector or riding on segregated cycle tracks rather than mixing it with buses and pedestrians. Until the level of dead or seriously injured cyclists resulting from not wearing a helmet rises significantly, it is not in the best interest of society to demand them to be made compulsory. By the way, I have been riding for many years in Italy: drivers certainly did not show higher level of respect than anywhere else, including the UK. I ride about  k miles a year and I feel safest around safe drivers, and unsafe drivers are the minority in all countries. I'm sure in all these anecdotes the word 'bike' could be exchanged for 'car' or 'walking' and they would still apply to a large number of accident victims. Is there a single argument for helmet wearing on bikes that doesn't apply equally to driving or walking? Wearing a helmet should be up to the cyclist, If I had worn one when I foolishly carried a package in a bap dangling from the handlebars (yes we all do it!) and I hit the groud hard, a helmet would have twisted my neck/head with fatal results as I slid (face down) on the road surface. Yes i had a few grazes but my arm protected my head to some degree. Medical staff have confirmed that a helmet would have twisted my head beyond the normal position. Now I take more care and consider risks more often I took a paralysed cyclist to hospital for rehab. I volunteer driving for local PTS. His surgeon told him that the ribs of his helmet could be responsible for breaking his neck the helmet not sliding over the road surface. The surgeon did not find the same injury with m/c helmets which are smooth. \"Proper\" bike lanes are difficult. To be useful, they have to follow a direct path from A to B. Many so-called bike paths follow artistic curves through parks and the like, which whilst being pleasant for a weekend jaunt aren't useful for my commute to work. The existing direct routes between A and B are generally speaking already occupied by roads, so a cycle path has to follow the road. In many cases, there just isn't room to build a physically separate path - a strip of coloured tarmac might be the best you can do. My wife and I started cycling   years ago as a means to keeping fit and active after finishing work. Eighteen month later I touched her back wheel and came off my bike. I had scrapes on elbow and knee, cuts and brises and remember my head hitting the floor and smashing the helmet. I would probably have been dead or very seriously injured without the helmet. Would you allow your children or grandchildren to ride without a helmet???? SORRY WIGGO IS RIGHT. The same absurd \"logic\" that people apply to seatbelts - without them you drive more carefully and with them you take more risks. Same with drink driving - drunk people take more care, sober people don't. I think people are debating the nature of helmets when they should be debating the nature of the law. A law requiring helmet use will probably serve mainly as a means to extract payments from those (e.g. students, teens, people who can't afford to maintain a car) not well able to afford them in the form of fines. If the police are short of cash, I fear they will implement this 'law' with excessive and pointless vigor, creating a largely victim-less crime. You do not have to be insured to ride a bike. Therefore it is nobody's business but your own what you wear when cycling, and it is certainly not a police matter. I am also suspicious about commercial motivations behind the general idea that to ride safely you need loads of equipment: gloves, helmet, knee pads, sunglasses, fluorescent jackets etc, all of which add up in terms of price. I don't think this equipment helps popularize cycling as a normal, everyday means of transport and there are evidently far better ways to guarantee cyclist safety, such as the 'Dutch' laws mentioned several times already. It would serve as an effective traffic calming measure and there is no question of extorting fines for trivial 'offenses' that would drive bike users off the road or otherwise persecute road users. It should go without saying that cyclists who don't follow the rules of the road should get booked like any other road user. A friend of mine was killed whilst cycling in an incident in which the car driver was going suspiciously fast. The coroner avoided blaming the driver, as it was the driver's word against the 'word' of a deceased as to what actually took place: not much of a contest really in the eyes of (willfully?) 'blind', 'impartial' justice. Incidentally, I suspect the aforementioned coroner drove to and from the inquest rather than cycled and that his concept of objectivity was informed by precisely this circumstance and the less than humane desire to let sleeping dogs lie and to lead a quiet life. Naturally, he chose to dwell on the fact that the deceased was not wearing a helmet and the driver does even get points on his licence. No doubt had my friend been using earphones, that would have drawn into the equation, though the car driver has, apparently, an absolute and unqualified right to listen to the radio whilst driving. I for one would never ride my mountain bike without a helmet for the simple reason I feel safer and if I happen to fall off for one reason or another then there is less risk of head injuries. One of my wifes friends husband came off his bike years ago and suffered head injuries from which he never recovered and never worked again. So think hard and say to yourself is it a hardship to wear a helmet? I think not. I suspect his reasons for saying cyclists should wear helmets are because he's sponsored by a helmet manufacture,but making helmets law will kill cycling as it did motorcycling,besides when you don't wear a helmet cars give you more room they have proved this many times and cycle helmets are only designed to withstand a    mph impact. One other possible explanation has been missed. Which is that a helmet restricts one's ability to act or react, and it takes time to get used to this. So Bradley Wiggins, spending a lot of time riding, will get used to the helmet andis no longer a hindrance. To someone cycling for a few minutes a day on average, they don't get used to the encumbrance. Just as I was always bumping the hard hat on things when I had to wear one as building site safety kit, but would not have hit my head since I knew wher it was. I have had enough hits or near misses from drivers who seem totally blind to cyclists, even wearing high-visibility jackets. (One in Acton derided me as \"canary\" and drove onto the pavement to chase me after a near miss when he pulled away without due care.) What we do need is radical education to teach drivers how to respect cyclists, and to teach cyclists basic rules of the road. We also need to design roads to encourage cyclists - just about every recent road change in Birmingham and SAndwell works against cyclists. And the one thing we could make compulsory is the high-vis jacket, which need not cost more than A  to A  in various forms. The problem lies in a barely visible bike navigating horrid potholes and other problems sharing a very small piece of the road with vehicles that tower over them. If a bike suddenly makes a lateral move, smack! The safest cities I've ridden in were all in China where bike lanes are very carefull isolated through posts, or even bigger barriers. Even passenger overheads have small ramps on the edges to acomodate cyclists. If a car cannot physically drive onto the bike lanes, then they are obviously not going to be running over people! SImply painting a line on the road is not going to do the trick. I've been hit by cars three times. Have you ever tried to cyce of a sewer grate surround by potholes with a car   feet away? I've been criticised already on here for my comments re: personal \"anecdotes\" of the benefits of helmets (John), from my clinical experience (I am still a nurse BTW). 'John' has also encouraged me to undergo my own science experiment at home re: breaking of Styrofoam. That's absolutely fine and I have no problem with these debates, that's what is good about them and my view was not necessarily saying there should be a law. But would people prefer a smashed helmet or smashed skull? Arguing that you didn't wear a helmet because the stats proved you didn't need to won't be possible when you are 'coning' on the way to the MRI scanner, with your family being told to prepare for the worst. Emotive, yes. Real world, yes. The real world is not a laboratory, but following that theme here's some simple medical science I can understand. Imagine a cyclist's head hitting an object (floor/ car etc): ?݃?݃?݃?..Which is likely to be more survivable? I know the answer from my clinical \"anecdotes\". We can argue stats till the cows come home as already mentioned, accidents do and will happen and our time is up at any moment. So it's behaviour we need to address. A helmet that MAY give me a fighting chance of surviving versus not wearing one is well worth it in my book. P.S. on the subject of why don't cyclists pay road tax, well it's not road tax it's emissions based tax, it doesn't give a vehicle driver any more rights than a cyclist. Would you argue a disabled driver or someone who drives a zero emissions car shouldn't be on the road either then? I have to disagree with the article, i was t-boned by a car that ran a red on Saturday, hit me at   mph and i walked away with fractured wrist, battered leg and a small lump on my head. i will always wear a helmet and won't ride with anyone that doesn't. You never know when a driver will do something stupid or a rabbit/pheasant might run out in front of you while you're doing   mph. its a personal choice but it madness to say not wearing a helmet is safer. any advice on how to claim for bike and loss of earnings?? Cheers Ben \"Cycle lanes work but they are expensive\".........simple! Make cyclists pay for their introduction and maintenance. Just like motorists who pay road tax. Cyclists should also pay insurance to cover the accidents they cause. A few points:  . In Holland, people generally are still pretty law-abiding. Also, in a motor accident involving a cyclist, the motorist is assumed to be at fault unless proven otherwise.  . Helmets do more than save life. Brain injuries are pretty horrible.  . A few years ago in Cape Town, a girl on a cycle was hit by a Kombi. The vehicle had to be jacked up to get her head from under the wheel, yet she had only minor injuries. Don't under-estimate helmets, and wear gloves. Gravel under the skin is not funny. Two years ago, I woke up in the ER two hours after a bicycle crash. My helmet was broken and the styrofoam partly crushed. Absent the helmet, I suspect it would have been my skull that was broken. I shall continue wearing a helmet. \"There is some evidence (the Department for Transport has some stats on this that it tried to bury a few years ago) which suggested that highly ??law abiding?? cyclists were more likely to be killed, particularly by commercial vehicles at junctions. This is because when push comes to shove, a cyclist is very often better off ??jumping?? a red light by a few seconds to avoid being crushed by a truck??s nearside turning left (a major cause of cycle accidents).\" Or, alternatively, when push comes to shove, a cyclist is very often undertaking a HGV to try to save a few seconds and is crushed by a truck??s nearside turning left (a major cause of cycle accidents). How do you equate \"law abiding\" with deliberately \"undertaking\" ? If they are going to insist on \"undertaking\", is it any wonder they are being \"buried\" ! One can argue the pro's and con's of wearing a helmet untill the cows come home but lets face it, the bike was invented when there were hardly any cars or any thing else on the road. It was in those far off days of empty roads safe to ride on. Now on our congested roads it is no longer safe no matter what you wear and that's it. End of. The bike is like the Dinasoures. Its history I always wear a helmet, and believe it may have saved my life when I had an accident (off-road) a few years ago. I know that in a lot of accidents it would be an irrelavance, but I value my brain, so I take that precaution, buy the best helmet I can afford, and replace it at least every year. However, I don't see any point in enforcing it by law. I am not a danger to others on my bike in the way that I am when I'm driving  /  tonne of metal glass and plastic at thirty miles/hr. I know there are always Top Gear style claims of 'irresponsible' cyclists causing apocalypse whenever cycling is in the news, but, really, it's the cyclist who suffers when things go wrong, so it is the cyclist who should shoulder the responsibility for his own safety. The responsibility of the motorist is already there: it's just a shame that so many flout that duty, drive like fools and blaming their potential victims. The simplist way to address deaths of cyclists would be to make any use of earphones/headphones illegal and make all bikes used on the roads of britain have a (either)   monthly or yearly test (like an MOT for a car), lights and reflectors fitted by law (before anyone goes on about theft of lights etc., i've got LED lights front and back on my bike, which i can remove in under    seconds and both fit in one pocket of my jacket...) Also, wearing a helmet, as pointed out in the article, would make some cyclists take more risks just as air-bags in cars have made drivers rely on their safety features (ABS etc.) If you remove your air-bag from your steering wheel and replace it with a  \" stainless steel spike, I bet you would drive a lot safer... I have been cycling on the roads of britain since i was about   years old, never had an accident because i'm watching what other road users are doing and taking avoiding action when needed. (there are several drivers who have had to replace nearside mirrors after cutting me up... ;-) ) Post a comment Comments are moderated, and will not appear on this weblog until the moderator has approved them.

            "   June      One step at a time for Australia-PNG relations BY BEN JACKSON THE FIRST STEP AN Australian government needs to take in attempting to understand the issues and perspectives of Papua New Guineans is to admit that they don't understand them at all. Martyn Namorong and I visited Parliament House in Canberra last Monday and Tuesday with the hope of bringing a fresh perspective on the PNG issues of land ownership, aid distribution and the long term role of Australia. In general, with Martyn's visit, the federal government squandered a rare opportunity to look beyond PNG's diplomatic and political elite and engage with a young Papua New Guinean who shows a precocious ability to understand, analyse and articulate the issues facing his country. Instead of seeking the insider knowledge available to them, and seeking to improve Australia-PNG relations, our frontline decision-makers on the Pacific seemed to me to be intent on self-aggrandisement. Too often patronising comparisons were drawn between Australia and Papua New Guinea and there was an underlying tone that \"it works here, so it should work over there\", with no consideration given to the huge cultural differences. The simplification of a complex truth is this: Papua New Guineans want their nation to be a more equitable version of PNG; not a miniature version of Australia. There haven't been many superlatives thrown at the current federal opposition, but they have proven to be both patient and opportunistic. Martyn and I were welcomed to Parliament House like old mates by Sam Riordan -- adviser to Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister, Hon Julie Bishop MP. We met with Sam several times before the appointment with Ms Bishop and each time he made no assumptions about his own knowledge; he listened and asked questions of Martyn. Before our eventual meeting with Julie Bishop, Martyn and I had the pleasure of meeting Hon Alan Griffin, former Minister for Veterans Affairs and Defence Personnel. By his own admission, Griffin's knowledge of PNG is not great, but his analysis and political nous were invaluable to us. Alan is a realist (he said cynic, but I think better of him) and there was no pandering or pretence that Australia and PNG have been and always will be best friends. He listened and offered constructive, sometimes blunt, advice on how Martyn should present issues to Australian politicians so that in time his views might effect real change. Sadly, just as many Papua New Guineans have been compromised by their government over the years, Alan has also been disenfranchised.  A good man excluded from the inner sanctum of the Labor Party because of internal division. While the government languished, the ever opportunistic opposition swung in. Sam Riordan had heard all the right things previously and Julie Bishop said all the right things. This was a meeting with a future minister and policy-maker who was extremely well briefed and enthusiastic to offer suggestions on progressing Australia-PNG relations. Ms Bishop was on topic and aligned with the issues Martyn came to Canberra to convey. I won't be so nave as to believe that everything we were told in Parliament House will emerge as concrete results, but there are at least some promising murmurs that might be enacted as foreign policy in the future. Ben Jackson managed the program for Martyn Namorong's tour and accompanied him on his visits to Sydney and Canberra What do our PNG friends think that this says about the relationship? ______________ Australian and New Zealand troops have been sent to Papua New Guinea as the country prepares for volatile general elections. Both countries have stated they are merely assisting the elections, but reports from Post Moresby suggest they are preparing in the event of a breakdown in social order. \"Australian troops are holed up in hotels around Port Moresby Airport,\" Denis Reinhardt a former adviser to the Papua New Guinea (PNG) government, said in an email. \"In any emergency, the two sites, which would be secured in POM (Port Moresby) would be the Australian High Commission and Jacksons Airport, for evacuations.\" Reinhardt says troops are already there and while he is receiving reports from Moresby that it is presently calm, he warns that it may not remain so. \"There will be sustained and scattered violent events in the lead up to elections,\" he wrote. Further warnings were made in a report from Sydney think tank, the Lowy Institute. They credit high \"financial bounty\" from PNG's rich resource sector, the \"enhanced value of political office,\" and a \"proliferation of weapons,\" as well as increased pressure on security forces as factors that have increased the likelihood of violence. \n",
            "   Nov      Michael Fassbender and Colin Firth are to star in 'Genius' as writer Thomas Wolfe and editor Max Perkins respectively. | Alan Rickman won praise from his Gambit director for stripping off and filming nude scenes in a glass-fronted London office block. The veteran actor shed his clothes for a scene in the comedy caper and he filmed it at    St Mary Axe, the London skyscraper known as the Gherkin, which was designed by famed architect Norman Foster and features floor-to-ceiling windows. Director Michael Hoffman reveals Rickman didn't ask him to close the set for his naked scene and went ahead with filming despite the worry of being overlooked by passers-by. He says, \"I did think it would be very hard to have an open set in an all-glass Norman Foster building. But he didn't ask for us to close it off - he was very brave\". Rickman,   , jokes, \"Sometimes you can get costumes you can't bear wearing. So it was a relief not to have to say, 'I don't like this costume.'\" The film, about an art curator who seeks revenge on his boss by selling him a fake Monet painting, is a remake of Sir Michael Caine's      movie of the same name and also featured an embarrassing scene for Rickman's co-star Colin Firth. The Oscar winner had to film without his trousers in front of real guests at London's upmarket Savoy hotel. \n",
            "   October        :   PM Why the history books will have to put an asterisk beside the Carter-less Cup Dan Carter, the man who was seemingly put on this earth to end the All Blacks'   -year World Cup curse, has been ruled out of the tournament with a groin tear. The people of New Zealand have taken the news like a kick to the same place. Carter collapsed in a freak training accident on Saturday. When he fell to the ground in agony, team-mates looked on nervously and the team doctor looked bewildered. The   -year-old fly-half has no history of groin problems and was doing his usual kicking practice when he tore his adductor longus tendon. What does this mean for the tournament? In a sense it is worse-case scenario. The poster boy is gone, the king has left the building. Everywhere you turn in New Zealand you are greeted by Carter's chiselled grin. He is on TV adverts, drinks bottles, billboards, magazines, coffee cups. Fly-half Colin Slade can never fill those boots, despite a perfectly competent performance against Canada yesterday. Carter is the central cog in the slick All Black machine; the flashy sidekick to general Richie McCaw; the man who can play at a million miles per hour yet break sweat as seldom as Roger Federer; the  ft   in giant whose shoulders never slumped under burden of delivering at the home World Cup. He is the best player in the world in the best team in the world, the kind of player who could put the kettle on in the middle of a dump tackle. He is also still improving. So much is made of his attacking prowess, but his defence has stepped up another gear this season. He scythes down big ball carriers who dare enter his No    channel, creating the platform for chief poacher McCaw to steal the ball. It is one reason the captain is so effective at the breakdown. He is a nice bloke too, the goody-two-shoes to Quade Cooper's arch-villain. Not unlike Jonny Wilkinson, he always has time for fans, staying longer than necessary at autograph signings. All Black coach Graham Henry held a dignified press conference yesterday confronted by a hysterical reaction from the Kiwi public. 'He??s been a world-class player for a long time, probably one of the greatest players ever produced by this country,' said Henry. 'This was going to be his pinnacle, the Rugby World Cup. We??ve had a lot of focus on this tournament for the last couple of years and it??s devastating he can??t be involved in that. 'It??s a tragic situation for a highly talented young sportsman. This was his scene really; a World Cup in New Zealand and it was going to be his big occasion.' Even if the All Blacks win this tournament they won't have their Hollywood ending. New Zealand has lost its leading man. Comments You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post.

            "   October       :   PM One Nation Ed has made off with Cameron's clothes By Tim Shipman Ed Miliband has just pulled off something that few politicians achieve. He has cheered his party faithful, rewritten the conventional wisdom about himself and, I suspect, sent a tiny frisson of fear rippling through Downing Street. By seeking to brand his party as One Nation Labour, he has stolen a Tory title of which David Cameron sees himself as the inheritor and sought to reposition the once union-shackled Red Ed of      in the centre ground of British politics. It was not a perfect speech, none is. Remarkably, for a speech delivered without notes, it was too long by a good    minutes. It was utterly vacuous in terms of policy detail and Mr Miliband still refuses to accept that Labour spent like drunken sailors in the good times. But if politicians are allowed one big picture speech shorn of policy per term, the conference   years before an election is the best time to do it. Mr Miliband's references to his secular faith, that everyone should be jolly nice to each other and make everything better, were among the most cloying and banal sections of any speech I have ever heard. There were also too many lazy, cheap applause lines like getting the audience to boo Michael Gove, an education secretary whose flagship policy has been to put rocket boosters under the schools reforms of Tony Blair and Andrew Adonis. But Mr Miliband has shown that he has the guts to deliver a speech without notes and the brain to memorise it. In that he has matched David Cameron. He has shown a modicum of geeky charm, riffing on his son Daniel's desire for 'dinosaurs' in the speech (tragically, a missed opportunity for a good gag at the expense of union barons). The Labour leader also tried a bit of 'I told you so' referencing his lines about producers and predators from last year's disastrously delivered pol-sci lecture. 'One year on people know what I was talking about,' he said. They sure as hell had no idea a year ago. But it is a measure of Mr Miliband's improvement that the problems with speech were what he left out (lack of guts on the economy and a lack of the big idea). Last year the problem was largely with what he included. Most importantly, he managed to ram home the most damaging accusation against the Tories, that they are a bunch of incompetent, pleb-denouncing public school rapscallions in a way that is memorable. By wrapping himself in the mantra of 'one nation' (a phrase you will now see in every speech and press release the Labour Party issues), a man who usually takes    long words to say anything has dramatised the alleged difference between the two main parties in two words. And he has used a Tory slogan, appropriated from David Cameron's heroes Benjamin Disraeli and Harold Macmillan, to do it. That is the measure of a successful speech and it will get them thinking in No   . It is as if the PM went off for a spot of skinny dipping and returned to the beach to find Mr Miliband wearing his Vilebrequins. In short it was the best conference speech by a Labour leader since Tony Blair's barnstorming valedictory in      and the most politically significant since Blair's backs-against-the-wall effort in the midst of the Iraq quagmire and Brown's serial disloyalty in     . David Miliband left the conference this morning to avoid 'overshadowing' his brother. A year ago when Ed Miliband's leadership was on the line this was a sensible move. Now it looks arrogant in its irrelevance. If the embittered elder brother did watch the speech, he will have been weeping over the CV he is presumably now writing. Ed Miliband has not won the general election. His ideas are often banal, his policies, where they exist, are often ill thought out. But he will be listened to more closely now. The British public may not yet believe that a Labour Party still in hock to the unions and in denial about its economic mismanagement can build One Nation. \"Why, I say, that to tax the community for the advantage of a class is not protection; it is plunder, and I entirely disclaim it.\" Ed is responsible for the Climate Change Act, which, it's estimated, will cost upwards of A    billion over next few decades. That cost will be paid for by ordinary voters who, through their energy bills are subsidising those that can afford solar panels as well as companies in the renewables industry making fat profits from such subsidies. Milliband is a hypocrite and opportunist of the worst kind, especially since the poorest in society (Labour supporters) will have to pay proportionately more for their energy. You political hacks are way too close to this. This speech appealed only to Labour's faithful. It won't change a single voter's mind, not least because they won't have watched it and they won't watch the highlights later either. EM's electability begins and ends with whether Labour is trusted on the economy. If the Tories preside over an improving economy and have scope for two rounds of tax cuts before     , Miliband and Labour are toast.

            "  /  /     The Bun Mobile There is a lot of buzz around The Bun Mobile -- wherever I look, there is a new review or someone posting a photo on facebook. I wondered if it's because the buns are really that good, or simply because it's the first food truck in Brisbane... I tried for a long time to track down the truck, but either the location was inconvenient for me or the time. And then one Saturday I saw a tweet \"We are at King George Square for lunch\" and that meant only one for me: It's time to try some buns! In the middle of a really hot day I dragged mu husband down there with me. We picked two buns: one special, which on that day was Korean miso glazed chicken, chilli, coriander, mint, sprout salad with wasabi mayo and fried shallots and the regular chicken bun. It wasn't even   minutes when I heard my name and the buns were handed to me. What should we do now? -- after a quick look around it was quite obvious, there was not enough shaded places there, so we could stay in a sun and eat quickly or go home, relax and eat there. Decision was easy, and the good news was when we arrived in our place, the buns were still warm. Although I'm not sure if the journey King George Sq -- home was the reason, but when I removed buns from the carton packaging, they were a bit soggy at the bottom and very sticky at the top. The regular chicken bun ($ ), was tasty, but the sweetness of a bun itself didn't work that well for me with all the sauces and the chicken. The daily special ($  ) was much better. Really fresh and crunchy salad and delicious chicken. The only thing that I'm not so sure about was way to much coriander, it overpowered all other flavours. Overall it was a pleasant experience, but not something I would go for from the other side of the city. I'm not becoming a big fan, but also am not saying \"never again\". I'll stay neutral and give them a second chance if our paths cross again. \n"

will head to Los Angeles to investigate The Silent Movie Theatre on Fairfax  Will they document proof that the theatre is still inhabited by two of its previous owners who died there  Harlem Renaissance After the American civil war  liberated African Americans searched for a safe place to explore their new identities as free men and women  They found it in Harlem  Read on to find out how this New York neighborhood became home to some of the best and brightest minds of the 20th century  gave birth to a cultural revolution  and earned its status as  the capital of black America   The Great Migration The end of the American Civil War in 1865 ushered in an era of increased education and employment opportunities for black Americans  This created the first black middle class in America  and its members began expecting the same lifestyle afforded to white Americans  But in 1896  racial equality was delivered a crushing blow when the Plessy v  Ferguson Supreme Court case declared racial segregation to be constitutionally acceptable  This created even harsher conditions for African Americans  particularly in some Southern states that sought to minimize the equality that former slaves and their descendants might aspire toward  The South also became gradually more and more economically depressed as boll weevils began to infest cotton crops  This reduced the amount of labor needed in the South  As a result  blacks began to head to the Northern United States by the millions  Racism  while still a serious obstacle  was considered much less brutal there than in the South  In addition  the North granted all adult men with the right to vote  provided better educational advancement for African Americans and their children  and offered greater job opportunities as a result of World War I and the industrial revolution  This phenomenon  known as the Great Migration  brought more than seven million African Americans to the North  Harlem  The Black Mecca Housing executives planned to create neighborhoods in Harlem designed specifically for white workers who wanted to commute into the city  Developers grew overambitious  however  and housing grew more rapidly than the transportation necessary to bring residents into the downtown area  The once exclusive district was abandoned by the white middle class  and frustrated developers were forced to cope with lower purchase prices than they first anticipated  White Harlem landlords started selling their properties to black real estate agents such as Philip A  Payton  John E  Nail  and Henry C  Parker  They also began renting directly to black tenants  Meanwhile  the re development and gentrification of midtown pushed many blacks out of the Metropolitan area  As a result  African Americans began moving to Harlem en masse  between 1900 and 1920 the number of blacks in the New York City neighborhood doubled  By the time the planned subway system and roadways reached Harlem  many of the country s best and brightest black advocates  artists  entrepreneurs  and intellectuals had situated themselves in Harlem  They brought with them not only the institutions and businesses necessary to support themselves  but a vast array of talents and ambitions  The area soon became known as  the Black Mecca  and  the capital of black America   The Harlem Renaissance During the early 1900s  the burgeoning African American middle class began pushing a new political agenda that advocated racial equality  The epicenter of this movement was in New York  where three of the largest civil rights groups established their headquarters  Black historian  sociologist  and Harvard scholar  W  E  B  Du Bois was at the forefront of the civil rights movement at this time  In 1905 Du Bois  in collaboration with a group of prominent African American political activists and white civil rights workers  met in New York to discuss the challenges facing the black community  In 1909  the group founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  NAACP   to promote civil rights and fight African American disenfranchisement  At this same time  the Jamaican born Marcus Garvey began his promotion of the  Back to Africa movement   Garvey founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League  UNIA ACL   which advocated the reuniting of all people of African ancestry into one community with one absolute government  The movement not only encouraged African Americans to come together  but to also feel pride in their heritage and race  The National Urban League  NUL  also came into being in the early 20th century  Founded by Ruth Standish Baldwin and Dr  George Edmund Haynes  the fledgling organization counseled black migrants from the South  trained black social workers  and worked to give educational and employment opportunities to blacks  Together  these groups helped to establish a sense of community and empowerment for African Americans not only in New York  but also around the country  In addition  they provided a rare opportunity for whites to collaborate with black intellectuals  social activists  educators  and artists in an attempt to transform a largely segregated and racist American society  Instead of using more direct political means to achieve their goals  African American civil rights activists employed the artists and writers of their culture to work for the goals of civil rights and equality  Jazz music  African American fine art  and black literature were all absorbed into mainstream culture  bringing attention to a previously disenfranchised segment of the American population  This blossoming of African American culture in European American society  particularly in the worlds of art and music  became known as The Harlem Renaissance  Culture Comes Together One of the first notable events of the Renaissance came shortly after the NUL began publishing Opportunity  A Journal of Negro Life  Believing that art and literature could lift African Americans out of their situation  the magazine s editor  Charles S  Johnson  began printing promising black writers in each issue  During Johnson s work for Opportunity  he met Jessie Fauset   the literary editor for Du Bois  NAACP magazine  Crisis  Fauset told Johnson about her first novel  There Is Confusion  1924   a story about middle class black women  In 1924  Johnson organized the first Civic Club dinner  which was planned as a release party for Fauset s book  The party was an instant success  and served as a forum for emerging African American artists to meet wealthy white patrons  The party managed to launch the careers of several promising black writers  including poets Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen   In 1925  shortly after the success of the Civic Club dinner  the magazine Survey Graphic  produced an issue on Harlem  Edited by black philosopher and Howard University professor  Alain Locke   the magazine featured work by prominent black writers of the time period  The magazine published work by writers Cullen  Hughes and Fauset  as well as poet Claude McKay and novelist Jean Toomer   Later that year  Locke expanded the special issue into an anthology called The New Negro  The collection fueled America s growing interest in African American writers  pushing black artists to the literary forefront  African American fine artists such as Aaron Douglas and Charles Alston also got their start through Alain Locke and Charles Johnson  who started publishing the artists  works as illustrations and cover art  Pulled into the spotlight  these fine artists used their fame as an opportunity to delve into the themes they found problematic to American culture  By introducing the  exoticizing  of Africa and notions of  the primitive  to white America  African American artists had their first opportunity to explore how these ideas could be used for and against their race  The Jazz Age With the conclusion of WWI came an end to wartime frugality and conservation  In an era of peace  Americans experienced an economic boom  as well as a change in social morays  Nicknamed  The Roaring 20s  for its dynamic changes  the decade became known for its celebration of excess and its rejection of wartime ideologies  Americans also began investing more time and money in leisure activities and artistic endeavors  Around this same time  Congress ratified the Prohibition Act  While the amendment did not ban the actual consumption of alcohol  it made obtaining it legally difficult  Liquor serving nightclubs  called  speakeasies  developed during this time as a way to allow Americans to socialize  indulge in alcohol consumption  and rebel against the traditional culture  One of the best speakeasies in Harlem was the Cotton Club  a place that intended to have the look and feel of a luxurious Southern plantation  To complete the theme  only African American entertainers could perform there  while only white clientele  with few exceptions  were allowed to patronize the establishment  This attracted high powered celebrity visitors such as Cole Porter   Bing Crosby and Doris Duke to see the most talented black entertainers of the day  Some of the most famous jazz performers of the time   including singer Lena Horne   composer and musician Duke Ellington   and singer Cab Calloway   graced the Cotton Club stage  Attending clubs in Harlem allowed whites from New York and its surrounding areas to indulge in two taboos simultaneously  to drink  as well as mingle with blacks  Jazz musicians often performed in these clubs  exposing white clientele to what was typically an African American form of musical entertainment  As jazz hit the mainstream  many members of older generations began associating the raucous behavior of young people of the decade with jazz music  They started referring to the 20s  along with its new dance styles and racy fashions  as  The Jazz Age   The End of the Renaissance As the 20s came to a close  so did white America s infatuation with Harlem  and the artistic and intellectual movements surrounding it  The advent of The Great Depression also crushed the wild enthusiasm of  The Roaring 20s   bringing an end to the decadence and indulgence that fueled the patronage of Harlem artists and their establishments  The depression hit the African American segment of the population hard  layoffs and housing foreclosures shut many blacks out of the American Dream that previously seemed so close at hand  The increased economic tension of the Depression caused black leaders to shift their focus from arts and culture to the financial and social issues of the time  In addition  the strained relationship between the black community and the white shop owners in Harlem finally tore the two groups apart in 1935  That alienation was expressed in the Harlem Riot of 1935  the nation s first modem race riot  The resulting violence finally shattered the notion of Harlem as the  Mecca  for African Americans  and broke the fleeting truce between white and black America  While the Renaissance as a historical movement was over  the effects it had on modern society were far from finished  The artistic and political movements of the 20s would live on in American culture in the form of new musical expression  award winning writing and  most importantly  the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s  These events  and the role Harlem would continue to play after the Renaissance  would change the American cultural landscape forever  \n",

            "017 The Time Meddler And so it begins  Gallifrey begins to emerge into the Doctor Who mythos  ready to take it s grand place alongside other significant Who staples  At last the noble race of Time Lords can stand revealed as we learn just where the Doctor came from  Except we don t  Don t worry  we will  Gallifrey  as Rassilon proclaimed not long ago  will rise  But The Time Meddler is more akin to a sneak peek and the Monk a rather less than sterling example of Gallifrey s finest  But I m getting ahead of myself  We open on a rather sinister looking clock ticking away  It s obviously an attempt at foreshadowing  but it just doesn t quite work for me  It puts me more in mind of the opening of Back to the Future  What is effective is the shot of the Doctor standing over the TARDIS controls as if he s just left Bad Wolf Bay  even without knowing what has gone before you can tell just looking at William Hartnell that he s suffered some kind of loss  Vicki is kind enough to bring us up to speed by discussing the recent departure of Ian and Barbara  It s quite easy to dismiss the importance of this event nearly half a century later  but their departure left Hartnell as the only remaining cast member from the opening episode  In a moment that sadly doesn t seem to have set a precedent the Doctor freely admits to being saddened by their departure  This isn t yet the gallivanting alien who picks up and deposits passengers like a interdimensional taxi driver  this is a man who is hurt enough by his abandonment to let it show and it s quite disconcerting   We may land in their time one day and be able to discuss old times   We know they won t  Even once the Doctor finally learns to fly the TARDIS we know that he seldom revisits old friendships outside of Sarah Jane and the Brig  but it leaves the door open nicely for Ian and Barbara to return and for the audience to not feel they re gone forever  As luck would have it just as Vicki and the Doctor are bemoaning their lack of company they hear what they presume to be a Dalek wondering round the TARDIS  It turns out instead to be Steven Taylor  played by Peter Purves   yes him from Crufts  rather than Jack Davenport  Whist Steven recovers with his cuddly panda  I m not joking  the TARDIS materialises on a beach  observed by a lone monk   He seems intrigued about the TARDIS  but not overly shocked  Almost as if he knows more than he should  The first time I saw The Time Meddler I was genuinely intrigued about the monk  after all the Internet had yet to spoil most of the series for me  I d imagine that most of you reading this review know fine well that the monk is in fact a Time Lord  No  Ah  Spoilers  Should have said  In the TARDIS Steven is being given a guided tour of his new home  The highlights for me include the horizontal control and  a chair with a panda on it   The tour concludes with the Doctor making a request of the new companion   Please stop buggering me   Meanwhile  back in the TARDIS Steven is being given a guided tour of his new home  The highlights for me include the horizontal control and  a chair with a panda on it   The tour concludes with the Doctor making a request of the new companion   Please stop buggering me   It s safe to presume from Vicki s face that this wasn t the intended line  however I can state with absolute certainty that whatever was initially scripted wasn t nearly as amusing  Steven s disbelief is somewhat refreshing  No polite disbelief or incredulous looks for him  As far as he s concerned this old man is off his rocker  but he takes it in good humour and continues to gently mock the Doctor for the rest of the episode  Indeed his mock interrogation of the Doctor s story leads to details of the craft being given within ear shot of the Monk s hearing  It s at this point I had to remind myself that this was made in the 60s  It s early days for the show s mythos and there is absolutely no reason that the Doctor should be able to sense the Monk just because he could sense the Master in his Tenth body  We re reminded  quite forcibly  that a lot of the show s continuity was cobbled together as it went along and that there was just no way the writers could anticipate their scripts having to conform to rules that wouldn t exist as we know them for decades to come  But I digress  As night falls on our crew it casts an eerie shadow over proceedings  that is until you hear the wildlife sounds cranked up just a little too much  I m still trying to decide if it was a plot point or not  The night shots are beautifully realised  Just as well really as the sun sets in this serial more times than it would in a Michael Bay film  Still  it looks the part  The Doctor informs the fourth wall that he misses having a History Teacher as a companion  He s not alone  not if it means we re spared such painful conversations  After wandering off from his companions the Doctor tries to casually ascertain the year from a local stopping just short of asking what the year actually is  He later informs the fourth wall that he misses having a History Teacher as a companion  He s not alone  not if it means we re spared such painful conversations  The monks chanting that the Doctor then overhears sounds suspiciously like a bad recording  So much so that when the chanting speed suddenly varies like a tape being chewed it takes me a few moments to realise that it s a plot point rather than a prop failure  although curiously the chanting is revealed as originating on a gramophone player  Possibly high technology at the time of broadcast  being a child of the late 70s I can only guess  but it certainly isn t a tape   The first episode ends with the Doctor being trapped by the Monk  We ll skip the second episode entirely as it feels very much like filler  probably due to the absence of the Doctor for the duration of it  When we finally catch up with him  the Doctor is casually discussing his escape with a local  Given his later fear and disdain of his fellow Time Lords he seems remarkably unconcerned about the Monk  Continuity tinted glasses again I guess  These same glasses muddy the waters somewhat when it comes to judging the Monk  On one hand he s seen healing the wounded and sick with penicillin  something quite Doctor like  and then we see him consulting his eight point plan for villainy  Seriously  He has an actual plan on a pull down chart   Position Atomic Canon  followed by  Sight Vikings  gives you an idea of just how well thought out his plan is  But the Monk isn t the highlight of this episode  it s the Doctor himself  The time off seems to have worked wonders for Hartnell and he returns in sparkling form and seems to relish taking on the Monk  A shame then that the Monk fails to live up to any kind of challenge  Having said that  their dialogue in the last episode gives us our first glimpse of where these Time Lords have come from   You know as well as I do the golden rule about space and time travelling   Never  never interfere with the course of history    Who says so   Asks the Monk and the thought occurs that his dialogue wouldn t be out of place spoken by the Fourth Doctor and to prove the point he finishes with  It s more fun my way   As the Monk rattles off his list of achievements to date you can t help but agree with him   Then when he mentions his hand in building Stonehenge you begin to wonder just who it was that built the Pandorica for the Alliance  Continuity Tinted Glasses again and if you watch this episode wearing them then you can t help but be struck by the sheer hypocrisy of the Doctor  Throughout this story the Doctor acts more like the Time Lords he s running from rather than the free spirit he s set to become  but when you consider that he only seems to be fifty years away from Gallifrey according to the Monk then it s really not that surprising he s still holding on to some of the basic tenets that he was raised with  His final solution of trapping the Monk on earth without a functioning TARDIS actually works better with the continuity glasses as it eerily foreshadows the Pertwee era  Speaking of the Monk s TARDIS  it s reveal at the end of Episode 3 must have been truly staggering at it s first showing  No one knew anything of where the Doctor came from and to discover one of his own kind half way through an historical must have been staggering for the audience of the time  Ultimately The Time Meddler works best for what it implies rather than what it shows  The Monk isn t anything close to a match for the Doctor despite superior equipment and could never be the Master in my mind  regardless of what some fan theories have suggested  However through his dialogue with the Doctor we learn an awful lot about where they came from and just who the Doctor might have been before we met him  And this wouldn t be the last time we met a Time Lord  Indeed  we might even meet this particular Time Lord again    I ll leave you with the highlight for me though  an exchange between Vicki and Steven discussing the implications of meddling with time   Memories will change  we re told  It s an explanation for every continuity error made during the fifty year run given  for all intents and purposes  at the very start of the run  Yet people still get upset when some things don t match up perfectly between episodes  About the author Alasdair Shaw dabbled in Who throughout the 80s  but didn t really get into it properly until 1989  His sense of timing has not improved over the years  He s a third generation Who fan as well as a father of two  His wife has a bad feeling about those two facts  When not working as a lab technician or writing for Kasterborous Alasdair runs the Doctor Who Reprint Society for which he writes In Print and Dangling Threads  He s a big fan of the Valeyard  but that s neither here nor there  He has never worked for UNIT and is not related to Dr Liz Shaw  we were so excited when we saw the inside of the monk s Tardis  It s difficult to explain how magical the Tardis control room was  It was the santuary  the place of safety that could be maddeningly out of reach  That is why the cliff hanger in the Web planet where the Tardis was apparently lost worked so well for us     there is absolutely no reason that the Doctor should be able to sense the Monk just because he could sense the Master in his Tenth body     maybe the Dr other Time Lords can only sense the presence of high ranking Time Lords  perhaps the Monk just doesn t cut it  Interestingly  the Dr later senses the presence of the presumed dead Morbius  when he s being drugged via the glass of wine at Solon s castle  I enjoyed reading this  AS  though I think you mean  basic tenets he was raised with  rather than  tenants   but I like the idea of the Monk growing up with flatmates  I remember at the time I first saw this in the early 1990 s on BBC2 thinking the implied rape of Edith was totally unsuitable for a children s programme and totlaly out of the keep of the rest of the story  I still think that  but as Edith seems to get over it very quickly I will too  I was really impressed with the cliffhanger for part three though and Peter Butterworth is really good throughout the story  I loved the Target novelizations of the Hartnell stories in the eighties  but being too young to have watched the stories on TV I had to imagine what those years looked like   Which was the magic of those books  They made us create our own vision of Doctor Who  and this demand on my imagination got me even more hooked on the show   But until I recently sat down and carefully watched every Hartnell adventure  I hadn t appreciated just how good Peter Purves was  Right from the start  he was a reliable foil for the Doctor  and he gives The Time Meddler a solid  human core  His anger at the end of The Massacre is the most believable dramatic moment of the Hartnell years  I d have loved to see him hang around longer to be a straight man to Troughton  The Monk could have been the Master  but of course it was never intended  I like to think that the Monk was Hartnell s functional equivalent of the Master  Except like many Doctor Who concepts  such as the Doctor at the time  he was unfinished and very much prototypical  unlike Troughton s War Chief  If you ve ever seen the War Games you ll know what i mean   The same 80 s Master that was in the King s Demons you mean  A basic rehash of the same story you just reviewed  C mon  even the Monk would facepalm the Master s sloppy execution in that story  I can t see why you d be baffled by the idea that someone would like to use their imagination  so what if someone likes the idea that the Monk was the Master  It s not a crime  I simply expressed both the Monk and the War Chief s functional equivalency to the Master  I could go as far as to say Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty s relationship was functionally similar to the Third Doctor and the Master  as was intended by the production team  Doesn t mean i think they are all the same character  I was going by your opening comment   The Monk could of been the Master   I m all for linking continuities and histories together  as long as there is some logic and substance presented with the argument  Apart from being Time Lords that the Doctor has fought I can t see a single connection  I ve not seen The King s Demons  but a quick glance through a synopsis reveals the Master s plan to be a little more thought out than the Monk s one  That s the beauty of it  a connection or a pattern is always in the eye of the beholder  But from a production point of view  they ll always be seperate characters  unless some future producer decides to highlight the issue  As for King s Demons  well i guess you ll just have to give it a spin  One of the Master s best wigs  and possibly his worst plan yet  Still fun to watch though What is interesting is that at the end of Episode 10 of The Daleks master Plan The Doctor strands The Monk on an ice planet and The Monk s last ever words if we accept your reasoning  are  I ll get you for this Doctor  I ll get you one day   In  Terror of the Autons   The Master s supposed  first  appearance  a Time Lord comes to warn The Doctor that  an old acquaintance has arrived on this planet  and that he  has learnt a great deal since you last met him   The original script also noted that  The Master  was a new alias  and that the Doctor had ruined one of  The Master  s schemes  and that  The Master  was out for revenge  The Doctor is unimpressed  That jackanapes  All hes does is cause trouble   he states and later  I refuse to be worried by a renegade like The Master  He s a  he s an unimaginative plodder   It is only when he sees that  The Master  has indeed learnt a great deal since they last met that he takes the threat seriously  And we know that when they last met The Master could not have been in his Delgado incarnation when The Doctor fails to recognise the voice on the telephone  Then there s the fact that The Monk was always going on about his  master plan   Or the fact that the Time lord specifically states that The Master scored higher marks in science than The Doctor  The Monk was able to fix his faulty chameleon circuit which The Doctor never did   and escape from 1066 in a TARDIS with a shrunken interior  It makes no sense he would never come after The Doctor again  And where was The Doctor s prior to Autons  meeting with The Master  The Master of Logopolis is reckless like The Monk  And Doctor Who Magazine ran an article shortly before the aforementioned King s Demons stating that it would feature the return of a villain first seen in The Time Meddler  Quite frankly  the idea that The Monk ISN T The Master is what I find bizarre  \n",

            "01 November 2012 The writers of our songs are the true national leaders  Let me write the songs of a nation  I don t care who writes the laws    Andrew Fletcher  Scottish politician WHEN HE FIRST TOOK OFFICE I used to hear news about Governor Powes Parkop s vision to clean the city and the people s mindsets by the year 2012  With that year coming to an end now  how have we fared  Have we changed  Parkop posed the question to a workshop of certain middle level bureaucrats   How do we get people to change their mindsets and attitudes   Indeed   How   Mindsets and attitudes cannot be legislated or regulated into being  They exist free of the external things we set up to control society  Conscience is the freest component of a human person  Inserted and guaranteed by God Himself  I could even say that the freedom of conscience is a freedom more precious than liberty itself  Throughout history and even today people have sacrificed their physical freedom and even their lives to keep their consciences free  And the most powerful of people have been those who have been able to permeate people s conscience  Leadership  I heard from Myles Munroe  is the ability to influence human behaviour  Human behaviour is a product of the human conscience  Leadership is therefore the ability to influence the human conscience to such an extent as it affects human behaviour  All these matters considered  I have concluded who the real leaders of this nation are  They are not the prime ministers  the members of parliament or the nation s top bureaucrats  They are not the ones who possess power or control over vast amounts of money or land or people  They are not those who have many wives and massive wealth  or who drive successful businesses and expensive vehicles  For me  the true leaders are smaller people  They probably live with relatives because they can t afford rentals  Maybe they make their homes in settlements  They possibly have small blue collar jobs that they struggle through every day  But they are famous people  Known and loved by many who share the same everyday experiences they do  They are the local songwriters  singers  poets  writers and the storytellers  But I ll focus on the songwriters and singers because that segment of the arts has more dominion in PNG than the storytelling  books and poetry  The majority in this nation listens to music and song every day  And songs have the ability to stick and continually play in the minds of people  The words  aided by music  can seep easily into our subconscious  shaping the mindset without us even knowing it  When we constantly listen to the same thing we usually end up believing it    without even making a conscious decision to start believing  Sooner or later we start living out the kind of beliefs transmitted by the songs  Our behaviour is affected  Human behaviour is shaped by what we constantly hear  see and read    by what is constantly communicated to us  Politicians can deliver speeches once in a while but their words do not dwell in our minds and hearts as much as songs and music  Hence politicians  despite having the authority to make laws and the macro decisions for the country  do not have much influence on the people s behaviour  That privilege  or responsibility  lies with our song writers and singers  The problem  however  is that many popular local songs are full of negative themes such as self pity and regret  low self esteem  loss of hope   I give up   etc  They are uninspiring and narrow minded  They stimulate fleeting desires that can never be satisfied  Those words  and the phrase  I m living for the weekend   reinforce within young people that life has no ultimate meaning or everlasting joy  but if we compound our pleasures every weekend    by taking alcohol  dancing away and picking up a one night stand    we may salvage some happiness  This is a dangerous message  Yet this song is  was  a hit with very young children who had yet to cement a proper outlook of life  Then there s Tania s Trupla Man  I once watched a TV program showcasing Tania promoting that song to hundreds of kids mostly below the age of 13  Some kids  possibly aged between 7 and 10  were called to the stage and sang the chorus brilliantly    Trupla man  wokobaut long bikpla nait  Painim mi  Em orait  Mi save long ting ting blong yu         A real man walks in the dead of the night looking for me  That s fine  I know what you re thinking   I thought to myself   What the heck   These kids are singing along without a clue as to what Tania s intent was  I doubt Tania herself knew   But very early a mentality is being embedded into their subconscious  It is  if your body desires something  get out there and do what it takes to satisfy your body  And if you do so you are a   trupla man    real man   Such songs are dangerous to our society  They summon up energies and curiosities within children and young people before they have built strong foundations from which they can properly direct such energy  They lack a message of hope  peace  unity and other positive themes that could energise Papua New Guineans to do the right thing  Yes we do have some of those more uplifting songs ringing through the air  but they re significantly outnumbered by the negative  Songs with such words are not just harmless music and entertainment  They shape human thought  They shape the conscience  They shape culture  If there are songwriters out there reading this  you have more power than you know  Use it well  As for politicians  if you d like to regain some of your lost power from the singers and songwriters  I recommend you ban the so many negatively charged songs that infiltrate almost every young heart every single day in Papua New Guinea  If we are to have a positive society with a positive culture we have to change the things that shape the minds that shape the behaviour of the people that shape our society  Comments You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post  Song lyrics are  for the greater part  geared towards entertainment  They reflect a certain frame of mind that the singer feels and wants to relate to the audience  Poetry  the less appreciated root of song lyrics  is more fundamental   poetry searches  poetry questions  poetry plumbs the depths of who we are and what we believe  Problem is most people just don t have the time  You could say that we d rather be brain washed through song than asked than meditate on poetry  Hear  hear  You just hit the nail on the head  Ganjiki  This is something I have been bemoaning for a long while now and you articulated it brilliantly for me there  I totally agree with you  However  your recommendation of banning a song may run against the grain of our stance on free speech and freedom of expression  Plus the act of banning almost always increases a creative work s marketability  Something like reverse psychology  if you may  The more viable option perhaps  would be to get this message    what you just wrote above    to all our people  and especially our songwriters  producers and recording studios so they can take some affirmative action on this matter  For example  we could have these artists invited to a workshop and through face to face and small group sessions  get them to this side of the picture  Make them realise the power they yield with their words in song  and how they can use it to better benefit the community  and in turn contribute to building a better society in Papua New Guinea  This could also provide an avenue for artists to share ideas with each other and with industry professionals on refining their music to break out of the shallow drivel of 1 beat mould  I m sure people like Allen  AK47  Kedea and even PNG music giants like Telek  here s me hoping  would be keen to participate in such a productive exercise as well  This collaborative act would blow any other collaborations out of the water     While on affirmative action  there s a National Symposium on Arts and Culture coming up next week  and I recall seeing some names from the music fraternity like Pati Doi and Oala Moi in the programme lineup  Guys  this agenda could surely do with some breathing room on the podium  \n",

            "02 August 2012 11 57 AM Sorry Wiggo  you are wrong about cycle helmets Bradley Wiggins is a top bloke  He lacks the unappealing narcissism of so many athletes  gives the impression that he has a life away from the saddle and is a Mod to boot  But that doesn  t stop him being  most probably  wrong about cycle helmets  On Wednesday night a cyclist was killed in a collision with an Olympic bus in Stratford  Speaking afterwards  Mr Wiggins said    Ultimately  if you get knocked off and you don  t have a helmet on  then you can  t argue    he said    You can get killed if you don  t have a helmet on    Well yes  that is unarguably true  but it is equally unarguably true that you can also get killed if you do have a helmet on  And here we enter one of the most vexed and controversial areas in the whole of statistics  the strange science of cycle safety  The whole issue of cycle helmets is so strange that David Spiegelhalter  the very excellent Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University  a man who knows more about accident stats than almost anyone else  half jokingly refuses to talk about it    Cycle helmets   he once told me    I try not to go there    The problem is that almost everything about cycle safety is counter intuitive  and a great deal of what we think we know is in fact guesswork  This we do know  in places were the wearing of helmets HAS been made compulsory  such as in some Australian states  cycling appears to become more dangerous and accident rates  and injuries  actually go up  Why  We don  t know  Maybe well publicised compulsory helmet laws make cycling appear to be more dangerous than it is  discouraging all by the brave  and reckless  from taking to the streets  Thus the number of cyclists may remain the same  but they may be drawn from a slightly different  more accident prone  population  Another  almost opposite explanation also suggests itself  Making people wear helmets may make cycling appear to be SAFER than it really is  This could encourage normally cautious types to take more risks  You see  This is far from straightforward  Finally  anything which makes cycling less appealing  and many people do not like wearing helmets  will reduce cyclist numbers  It may also encourage motorists to take more chances around bikes  as they subconsciously calculate that anyone on two wheels is   protected    We know other things  The safest places to ride a bike are places where the most bikes are ridden  You are far  far less likely to be killed on a bicycle on the streets of Amsterdam or Copenhagen than you are in New York or Los Angeles  The safest places to ride a bike are also places were almost no one wears a helmet at all  I don  t think I have ever seen a Dutchman or woman wearing head protection  and the Netherlands   road safety record is excellent   matching ours  in fact  as the best in the world  although it is a better place to ride a bike   More cyclists equals fewer accidents  Several possible reasons for this  There  s the   critical mass   theory that says simply that as bikes become commonplace motorists learn to give them more space and treat them as equals  Perhaps more importantly  in a rich country where almost everyone rides a bike  such as Denmark  many  if not most  of these cyclists will also drive cars  The safest drivers where cyclists are concerned are also  probably  cyclists themselves  But of course the direction of the causal arrow is not entirely clear  It may be that places with safe roads  proper provision for cyclists  especially dedicated cycle lanes  simply encourage more people to cycle  It  s probably a bit of both  More statistical oddities  women  although generally less reckless on the road  are slightly more likely to come to grief on a bike  Not because they are   worse   cyclists but in fact because they are better  There is some evidence  the Department for Transport has some stats on this that it tried to bury a few years ago  which suggested that highly   law abiding   cyclists were more likely to be killed  particularly by commercial vehicles at junctions  This is because when push comes to shove  a cyclist is very often better off   jumping   a red light by a few seconds to avoid being crushed by a truck  s nearside turning left  a major cause of cycle accidents   I don  t know whether wearing a cycle helmet makes it less likely that you will die on the roads or not  I suspect the latter but I wear one anyway  when I remember  I strongly suspect  although again I do not know for sure  because no one does  that making helmet wearing compulsory will not help and will probably make things worse  I know more bikes on the road makes those bikes safer  as well as reducing traffic congestion  pollution  and so on   I know that the risks FROM cyclists are so minute to be irrelevant  a handful of pedestrians are killed or seriously injured by bikes every year compared to the hundreds of cyclists and pedestrians killed by cars and  especially  trucks and buses  I know that probably the single best way of encouraging more people to cycle would be the provision of proper  dedicated cycle lanes  London Mayor Boris Johnson is a keen cyclist and must be commended for raising the profile of cycling in London but his big blue cycle lanes are for the most part merely markings on the road  not lanes where cyclists are safe from being mown down by vehicles a hundred times their weight travelling at twice their speed  Cycle lanes work but they are expensive and councils see to put them at the bottom of their priority lists  Finally  we can surely do something about the infestation of heavy goods vehicles in our cities  I do not fully understand why the streets of London are clogged by massive 18 wheelers whereas the streets of Paris or Vienna are not  Bradley Wiggins is  probably  wrong about cycle helmets  his comments on not listening toiPOds and using lights at night were bang on the money  but by giving cycling such a high profile he may be doing a great deal for cycle safety anyway  by encouraging a new generation of youngsters to take to the roads on two wheels  Share this article  Comments You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the comment feed for this post  We also have to remember WHEN riding a bike  car   using our legs  Trust in ourselves is sadly not all that s to it  A lot of accidents can happy by other road users  Not having an airbag is not at all safe  Why  because you can be the safest driver in the world but it doesn t stop another driving smashing into the back of you causing your head to smash though the wind screen       We need a more active nation  all fair and well Boris bringing out his bikes but where s the safety   What an awful article the Mail has produced  How can one person say wearing a helmet can hinder people  I ve seen comments taking into account of the shape of helmets and other risk facts  But this writer hasn t really made any valid points at all   Making people wear helmets may make cycling appear to be SAFER than it really is  This could encourage normally cautious types to take more risks  Yes well done cycling appears safer when wearing a helmet  Why  because that person is wearing a hard shell around their head that protects their skull from crushing if it hits the ground fast  Surely wearing a helmet would never make a person less more weary  Perhaps wearing a helmet would make the person feel comfortable but what studies   experiments do you have about people not looking because they re so preoccupied about having something on their head   Bottom line is if children are reading this  Helmets are incredibly cool  Lots of people s lives could have been saved if these people wore a helmet during their accident  Please consider this article as another one of the Mail s failed attempt at journalism  If helmets with sticky out bits make people weary consider the  bmx helmet  smooth round basic matte helmet  very cool and very trust worthy  I think debating whether helmets are effective and debating whether helmets should be made compulsory are two different topics  For a safety measure to be made compulsory it has to be practically enforceable  Forcing and policing cyclists to wear helmets is not as such  Bicycles do not come equipped with helmets that fit everyone providing the minimum level of protection  and they are not practical for the majority of the population  Regular cyclists are not what we are talking about here  We are talking about people who decide to occasionally ride a bike  just like people occasionally decide to ride the London Underground or a train or a bus or a taxi with children  Think of the Cycle hire scheme for example as a form of public transport  In those cases  exemptions are made so that the general public find such transport systems convenient  When we talk about personal transport  a cyclist must be able to carry the helmet in such a way that its integrity is not compromised  This is very impractical at the moment  Let s take some examples from real life  seat belts come fitted to all cars  you don t need to carry your own seatbelt with you at all times  On the other hand  if you travel with kids and need to take a taxi  you won t be required to have a child seat  So  helmets might be the most effective way to protect from head injuries for cyclists  but due to infrequent nature of such accidents  the general consensus is that if you find yourself in a situation with higher risk for head injuries  you should be responsible for your own safety because the cost of policing that  everyone  wears one is not required  I personally wear a helmet when I figure the risk of head injuries is higher  But yes  it is left to the individual just like the choice of the type of helmet  and the choice of wearing hi viz or wearing a spine protector or riding on segregated cycle tracks rather than mixing it with buses and pedestrians  Until the level of dead or seriously injured cyclists resulting from not wearing a helmet rises significantly  it is not in the best interest of society to demand them to be made compulsory  By the way  I have been riding for many years in Italy  drivers certainly did not show higher level of respect than anywhere else  including the UK  I ride about 4k miles a year and I feel safest around safe drivers  and unsafe drivers are the minority in all countries  I m sure in all these anecdotes the word  bike  could be exchanged for  car  or  walking  and they would still apply to a large number of accident victims  Is there a single argument for helmet wearing on bikes that doesn t apply equally to driving or walking  Wearing a helmet should be up to the cyclist  If I had worn one when I foolishly carried a package in a bap dangling from the handlebars  yes we all do it   and I hit the groud hard  a helmet would have twisted my neck head with fatal results as I slid  face down  on the road surface  Yes i had a few grazes but my arm protected my head to some degree  Medical staff have confirmed that a helmet would have twisted my head beyond the normal position  Now I take more care and consider risks more often I took a paralysed cyclist to hospital for rehab  I volunteer driving for local PTS  His surgeon told him that the ribs of his helmet could be responsible for breaking his neck the helmet not sliding over the road surface  The surgeon did not find the same injury with m c helmets which are smooth   Proper  bike lanes are difficult  To be useful  they have to follow a direct path from A to B  Many so called bike paths follow artistic curves through parks and the like  which whilst being pleasant for a weekend jaunt aren t useful for my commute to work  The existing direct routes between A and B are generally speaking already occupied by roads  so a cycle path has to follow the road  In many cases  there just isn t room to build a physically separate path   a strip of coloured tarmac might be the best you can do  My wife and I started cycling 3 years ago as a means to keeping fit and active after finishing work  Eighteen month later I touched her back wheel and came off my bike  I had scrapes on elbow and knee  cuts and brises and remember my head hitting the floor and smashing the helmet  I would probably have been dead or very seriously injured without the helmet  Would you allow your children or grandchildren to ride without a helmet     SORRY WIGGO IS RIGHT  The same absurd  logic  that people apply to seatbelts   without them you drive more carefully and with them you take more risks  Same with drink driving   drunk people take more care  sober people don t  I think people are debating the nature of helmets when they should be debating the nature of the law  A law requiring helmet use will probably serve mainly as a means to extract payments from those  e g  students  teens  people who can t afford to maintain a car  not well able to afford them in the form of fines  If the police are short of cash  I fear they will implement this  law  with excessive and pointless vigor  creating a largely victim less crime  You do not have to be insured to ride a bike  Therefore it is nobody s business but your own what you wear when cycling  and it is certainly not a police matter  I am also suspicious about commercial motivations behind the general idea that to ride safely you need loads of equipment  gloves  helmet  knee pads  sunglasses  fluorescent jackets etc  all of which add up in terms of price  I don t think this equipment helps popularize cycling as a normal  everyday means of transport and there are evidently far better ways to guarantee cyclist safety  such as the  Dutch  laws mentioned several times already  It would serve as an effective traffic calming measure and there is no question of extorting fines for trivial  offenses  that would drive bike users off the road or otherwise persecute road users  It should go without saying that cyclists who don t follow the rules of the road should get booked like any other road user  A friend of mine was killed whilst cycling in an incident in which the car driver was going suspiciously fast  The coroner avoided blaming the driver  as it was the driver s word against the  word  of a deceased as to what actually took place  not much of a contest really in the eyes of  willfully    blind    impartial  justice  Incidentally  I suspect the aforementioned coroner drove to and from the inquest rather than cycled and that his concept of objectivity was informed by precisely this circumstance and the less than humane desire to let sleeping dogs lie and to lead a quiet life  Naturally  he chose to dwell on the fact that the deceased was not wearing a helmet and the driver does even get points on his licence  No doubt had my friend been using earphones  that would have drawn into the equation  though the car driver has  apparently  an absolute and unqualified right to listen to the radio whilst driving  I for one would never ride my mountain bike without a helmet for the simple reason I feel safer and if I happen to fall off for one reason or another then there is less risk of head injuries  One of my wifes friends husband came off his bike years ago and suffered head injuries from which he never recovered and never worked again  So think hard and say to yourself is it a hardship to wear a helmet  I think not  I suspect his reasons for saying cyclists should wear helmets are because he s sponsored by a helmet manufacture but making helmets law will kill cycling as it did motorcycling besides when you don t wear a helmet cars give you more room they have proved this many times and cycle helmets are only designed to withstand a 15 mph impact  One other possible explanation has been missed  Which is that a helmet restricts one s ability to act or react  and it takes time to get used to this  So Bradley Wiggins  spending a lot of time riding  will get used to the helmet andis no longer a hindrance  To someone cycling for a few minutes a day on average  they don t get used to the encumbrance  Just as I was always bumping the hard hat on things when I had to wear one as building site safety kit  but would not have hit my head since I knew wher it was  I have had enough hits or near misses from drivers who seem totally blind to cyclists  even wearing high visibility jackets   One in Acton derided me as  canary  and drove onto the pavement to chase me after a near miss when he pulled away without due care   What we do need is radical education to teach drivers how to respect cyclists  and to teach cyclists basic rules of the road  We also need to design roads to encourage cyclists   just about every recent road change in Birmingham and SAndwell works against cyclists  And the one thing we could make compulsory is the high vis jacket  which need not cost more than A1 to A5 in various forms  The problem lies in a barely visible bike navigating horrid potholes and other problems sharing a very small piece of the road with vehicles that tower over them  If a bike suddenly makes a lateral move  smack  The safest cities I ve ridden in were all in China where bike lanes are very carefull isolated through posts  or even bigger barriers  Even passenger overheads have small ramps on the edges to acomodate cyclists  If a car cannot physically drive onto the bike lanes  then they are obviously not going to be running over people  SImply painting a line on the road is not going to do the trick  I ve been hit by cars three times  Have you ever tried to cyce of a sewer grate surround by potholes with a car 2 feet away  I ve been criticised already on here for my comments re  personal  anecdotes  of the benefits of helmets  John   from my clinical experience  I am still a nurse BTW    John  has also encouraged me to undergo my own science experiment at home re  breaking of Styrofoam  That s absolutely fine and I have no problem with these debates  that s what is good about them and my view was not necessarily saying there should be a law  But would people prefer a smashed helmet or smashed skull  Arguing that you didn t wear a helmet because the stats proved you didn t need to won t be possible when you are  coning  on the way to the MRI scanner  with your family being told to prepare for the worst  Emotive  yes  Real world  yes  The real world is not a laboratory  but following that theme here s some simple medical science I can understand  Imagine a cyclist s head hitting an object  floor  car etc    ݃ ݃ ݃   Which is likely to be more survivable  I know the answer from my clinical  anecdotes   We can argue stats till the cows come home as already mentioned  accidents do and will happen and our time is up at any moment  So it s behaviour we need to address  A helmet that MAY give me a fighting chance of surviving versus not wearing one is well worth it in my book  P S  on the subject of why don t cyclists pay road tax  well it s not road tax it s emissions based tax  it doesn t give a vehicle driver any more rights than a cyclist  Would you argue a disabled driver or someone who drives a zero emissions car shouldn t be on the road either then  I have to disagree with the article  i was t boned by a car that ran a red on Saturday  hit me at 50mph and i walked away with fractured wrist  battered leg and a small lump on my head  i will always wear a helmet and won t ride with anyone that doesn t  You never know when a driver will do something stupid or a rabbit pheasant might run out in front of you while you re doing 25mph  its a personal choice but it madness to say not wearing a helmet is safer  any advice on how to claim for bike and loss of earnings   Cheers Ben  Cycle lanes work but they are expensive          simple  Make cyclists pay for their introduction and maintenance  Just like motorists who pay road tax  Cyclists should also pay insurance to cover the accidents they cause  A few points  1  In Holland  people generally are still pretty law abiding  Also  in a motor accident involving a cyclist  the motorist is assumed to be at fault unless proven otherwise  2  Helmets do more than save life  Brain injuries are pretty horrible  3  A few years ago in Cape Town  a girl on a cycle was hit by a Kombi  The vehicle had to be jacked up to get her head from under the wheel  yet she had only minor injuries  Don t under estimate helmets  and wear gloves  Gravel under the skin is not funny  Two years ago  I woke up in the ER two hours after a bicycle crash  My helmet was broken and the styrofoam partly crushed  Absent the helmet  I suspect it would have been my skull that was broken  I shall continue wearing a helmet   There is some evidence  the Department for Transport has some stats on this that it tried to bury a few years ago  which suggested that highly   law abiding   cyclists were more likely to be killed  particularly by commercial vehicles at junctions  This is because when push comes to shove  a cyclist is very often better off   jumping   a red light by a few seconds to avoid being crushed by a truck  s nearside turning left  a major cause of cycle accidents    Or  alternatively  when push comes to shove  a cyclist is very often undertaking a HGV to try to save a few seconds and is crushed by a truck  s nearside turning left  a major cause of cycle accidents   How do you equate  law abiding  with deliberately  undertaking    If they are going to insist on  undertaking   is it any wonder they are being  buried    One can argue the pro s and con s of wearing a helmet untill the cows come home but lets face it  the bike was invented when there were hardly any cars or any thing else on the road  It was in those far off days of empty roads safe to ride on  Now on our congested roads it is no longer safe no matter what you wear and that s it  End of  The bike is like the Dinasoures  Its history I always wear a helmet  and believe it may have saved my life when I had an accident  off road  a few years ago  I know that in a lot of accidents it would be an irrelavance  but I value my brain  so I take that precaution  buy the best helmet I can afford  and replace it at least every year  However  I don t see any point in enforcing it by law  I am not a danger to others on my bike in the way that I am when I m driving 3 4 tonne of metal glass and plastic at thirty miles hr  I know there are always Top Gear style claims of  irresponsible  cyclists causing apocalypse whenever cycling is in the news  but  really  it s the cyclist who suffers when things go wrong  so it is the cyclist who should shoulder the responsibility for his own safety  The responsibility of the motorist is already there  it s just a shame that so many flout that duty  drive like fools and blaming their potential victims  The simplist way to address deaths of cyclists would be to make any use of earphones headphones illegal and make all bikes used on the roads of britain have a  either  6 monthly or yearly test  like an MOT for a car   lights and reflectors fitted by law  before anyone goes on about theft of lights etc   i ve got LED lights front and back on my bike  which i can remove in under 10 seconds and both fit in one pocket of my jacket     Also  wearing a helmet  as pointed out in the article  would make some cyclists take more risks just as air bags in cars have made drivers rely on their safety features  ABS etc   If you remove your air bag from your steering wheel and replace it with a 6  stainless steel spike  I bet you would drive a lot safer    I have been cycling on the roads of britain since i was about 8 years old  never had an accident because i m watching what other road users are doing and taking avoiding action when needed   there are several drivers who have had to replace nearside mirrors after cutting me up          Post a comment Comments are moderated  and will not appear on this weblog until the moderator has approved them  They must not exceed 500

            "02 June 2012 One step at a time for Australia PNG relations BY BEN JACKSON THE FIRST STEP AN Australian government needs to take in attempting to understand the issues and perspectives of Papua New Guineans is to admit that they don t understand them at all  Martyn Namorong and I visited Parliament House in Canberra last Monday and Tuesday with the hope of bringing a fresh perspective on the PNG issues of land ownership  aid distribution and the long term role of Australia  In general  with Martyn s visit  the federal government squandered a rare opportunity to look beyond PNG s diplomatic and political elite and engage with a young Papua New Guinean who shows a precocious ability to understand  analyse and articulate the issues facing his country  Instead of seeking the insider knowledge available to them  and seeking to improve Australia PNG relations  our frontline decision makers on the Pacific seemed to me to be intent on self aggrandisement  Too often patronising comparisons were drawn between Australia and Papua New Guinea and there was an underlying tone that  it works here  so it should work over there   with no consideration given to the huge cultural differences  The simplification of a complex truth is this  Papua New Guineans want their nation to be a more equitable version of PNG  not a miniature version of Australia  There haven t been many superlatives thrown at the current federal opposition  but they have proven to be both patient and opportunistic  Martyn and I were welcomed to Parliament House like old mates by Sam Riordan    adviser to Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister  Hon Julie Bishop MP  We met with Sam several times before the appointment with Ms Bishop and each time he made no assumptions about his own knowledge  he listened and asked questions of Martyn  Before our eventual meeting with Julie Bishop  Martyn and I had the pleasure of meeting Hon Alan Griffin  former Minister for Veterans Affairs and Defence Personnel  By his own admission  Griffin s knowledge of PNG is not great  but his analysis and political nous were invaluable to us  Alan is a realist  he said cynic  but I think better of him  and there was no pandering or pretence that Australia and PNG have been and always will be best friends  He listened and offered constructive  sometimes blunt  advice on how Martyn should present issues to Australian politicians so that in time his views might effect real change  Sadly  just as many Papua New Guineans have been compromised by their government over the years  Alan has also been disenfranchised   A good man excluded from the inner sanctum of the Labor Party because of internal division  While the government languished  the ever opportunistic opposition swung in  Sam Riordan had heard all the right things previously and Julie Bishop said all the right things  This was a meeting with a future minister and policy maker who was extremely well briefed and enthusiastic to offer suggestions on progressing Australia PNG relations  Ms Bishop was on topic and aligned with the issues Martyn came to Canberra to convey  I won t be so nave as to believe that everything we were told in Parliament House will emerge as concrete results  but there are at least some promising murmurs that might be enacted as foreign policy in the future  Ben Jackson managed the program for Martyn Namorong s tour and accompanied him on his visits to Sydney and Canberra What do our PNG friends think that this says about the relationship                 Australian and New Zealand troops have been sent to Papua New Guinea as the country prepares for volatile general elections  Both countries have stated they are merely assisting the elections  but reports from Post Moresby suggest they are preparing in the event of a breakdown in social order   Australian troops are holed up in hotels around Port Moresby Airport   Denis Reinhardt a former adviser to the Papua New Guinea  PNG  government  said in an email   In any emergency  the two sites  which would be secured in POM  Port Moresby  would be the Australian High Commission and Jacksons Airport  for evacuations   Reinhardt says troops are already there and while he is receiving reports from Moresby that it is presently calm  he warns that it may not remain so   There will be sustained and scattered violent events in the lead up to elections   he wrote  Further warnings were made in a report from Sydney think tank  the Lowy Institute  They credit high  financial bounty  from PNG s rich resource sector  the  enhanced value of political office   and a  proliferation of weapons   as well as increased pressure on security forces as factors that have increased the likelihood of violence  \n",

            "02 October 2012 4 28 PM One Nation Ed has made off with Cameron s clothes By Tim Shipman Ed Miliband has just pulled off something that few politicians achieve  He has cheered his party faithful  rewritten the conventional wisdom about himself and  I suspect  sent a tiny frisson of fear rippling through Downing Street  By seeking to brand his party as One Nation Labour  he has stolen a Tory title of which David Cameron sees himself as the inheritor and sought to reposition the once union shackled Red Ed of 2010 in the centre ground of British politics  It was not a perfect speech  none is  Remarkably  for a speech delivered without notes  it was too long by a good 10 minutes  It was utterly vacuous in terms of policy detail and Mr Miliband still refuses to accept that Labour spent like drunken sailors in the good times  But if politicians are allowed one big picture speech shorn of policy per term  the conference 3 years before an election is the best time to do it  Mr Miliband s references to his secular faith  that everyone should be jolly nice to each other and make everything better  were among the most cloying and banal sections of any speech I have ever heard  There were also too many lazy  cheap applause lines like getting the audience to boo Michael Gove  an education secretary whose flagship policy has been to put rocket boosters under the schools reforms of Tony Blair and Andrew Adonis  But Mr Miliband has shown that he has the guts to deliver a speech without notes and the brain to memorise it  In that he has matched David Cameron  He has shown a modicum of geeky charm  riffing on his son Daniel s desire for  dinosaurs  in the speech  tragically  a missed opportunity for a good gag at the expense of union barons   The Labour leader also tried a bit of  I told you so  referencing his lines about producers and predators from last year s disastrously delivered pol sci lecture   One year on people know what I was talking about   he said  They sure as hell had no idea a year ago  But it is a measure of Mr Miliband s improvement that the problems with speech were what he left out  lack of guts on the economy and a lack of the big idea   Last year the problem was largely with what he included  Most importantly  he managed to ram home the most damaging accusation against the Tories  that they are a bunch of incompetent  pleb denouncing public school rapscallions in a way that is memorable  By wrapping himself in the mantra of  one nation   a phrase you will now see in every speech and press release the Labour Party issues   a man who usually takes 22 long words to say anything has dramatised the alleged difference between the two main parties in two words  And he has used a Tory slogan  appropriated from David Cameron s heroes Benjamin Disraeli and Harold Macmillan  to do it  That is the measure of a successful speech and it will get them thinking in No 10  It is as if the PM went off for a spot of skinny dipping and returned to the beach to find Mr Miliband wearing his Vilebrequins  In short it was the best conference speech by a Labour leader since Tony Blair s barnstorming valedictory in 2006 and the most politically significant since Blair s backs against the wall effort in the midst of the Iraq quagmire and Brown s serial disloyalty in 2004  David Miliband left the conference this morning to avoid  overshadowing  his brother  A year ago when Ed Miliband s leadership was on the line this was a sensible move  Now it looks arrogant in its irrelevance  If the embittered elder brother did watch the speech  he will have been weeping over the CV he is presumably now writing  Ed Miliband has not won the general election  His ideas are often banal  his policies  where they exist  are often ill thought out  But he will be listened to more closely now  The British public may not yet believe that a Labour Party still in hock to the unions and in denial about its economic mismanagement can build One Nation   Why  I say  that to tax the community for the advantage of a class is not protection  it is plunder  and I entirely disclaim it   Ed is responsible for the Climate Change Act  which  it s estimated  will cost upwards of A200 billion over next few decades  That cost will be paid for by ordinary voters who  through their energy bills are subsidising those that can afford solar panels as well as companies in the renewables industry making fat profits from such subsidies  Milliband is a hypocrite and opportunist of the worst kind  especially since the poorest in society  Labour supporters  will have to pay proportionately more for their energy  You political hacks are way too close to this  This speech appealed only to Labour s faithful  It won t change a single voter s mind  not least because they won t have watched it and they won t watch the highlights later either  EM s electability begins and ends with whether Labour is trusted on the economy  If the Tories preside over an improving economy and have scope for two rounds of tax cuts before 2015  Miliband and Labour are toast  Post a comment Comments are moderated  and will not appear on this weblog until

            "03 10 2012 The Bun Mobile There is a lot of buzz around The Bun Mobile    wherever I look  there is a new review or someone posting a photo on facebook  I wondered if it s because the buns are really that good  or simply because it s the first food truck in Brisbane    I tried for a long time to track down the truck  but either the location was inconvenient for me or the time  And then one Saturday I saw a tweet  We are at King George Square for lunch  and that meant only one for me  It s time to try some buns  In the middle of a really hot day I dragged mu husband down there with me  We picked two buns  one special  which on that day was Korean miso glazed chicken  chilli  coriander  mint  sprout salad with wasabi mayo and fried shallots and the regular chicken bun  It wasn t even 5 minutes when I heard my name and the buns were handed to me  What should we do now     after a quick look around it was quite obvious  there was not enough shaded places there  so we could stay in a sun and eat quickly or go home  relax and eat there  Decision was easy  and the good news was when we arrived in our place  the buns were still warm  Although I m not sure if the journey King George Sq    home was the reason  but when I removed buns from the carton packaging  they were a bit soggy at the bottom and very sticky at the top  The regular chicken bun   8   was tasty  but the sweetness of a bun itself didn t work that well for me with all the sauces and the chicken  The daily special   10  was much better  Really fresh and crunchy salad and delicious chicken  The only thing that I m not so sure about was way to much coriander  it overpowered all other flavours  Overall it was a pleasant experience  but not something I would go for from the other side of the city  I m not becoming a big fan  but also am not saying  never again   I ll stay neutral and give them a second chance if our paths cross again  \n"

will head to los angeles to investigate the silent movie theatre on fairfax  will they document proof that the theatre is still inhabited by two of its previous owners who died there  harlem renaissance after the american civil war  liberated african americans searched for a safe place to explore their new identities as free men and women  they found it in harlem  read on to find out how this new york neighborhood became home to some of the best and brightest minds of the   th century  gave birth to a cultural revolution  and earned its status as  the capital of black america   the great migration the end of the american civil war in      ushered in an era of increased education and employment opportunities for black americans  this created the first black middle class in america  and its members began expecting the same lifestyle afforded to white americans  but in       racial equality was delivered a crushing blow when the plessy v  ferguson supreme court case declared racial segregation to be constitutionally acceptable  this created even harsher conditions for african americans  particularly in some southern states that sought to minimize the equality that former slaves and their descendants might aspire toward  the south also became gradually more and more economically depressed as boll weevils began to infest cotton crops  this reduced the amount of labor needed in the south  as a result  blacks began to head to the northern united states by the millions  racism  while still a serious obstacle  was considered much less brutal there than in the south  in addition  the north granted all adult men with the right to vote  provided better educational advancement for african americans and their children  and offered greater job opportunities as a result of world war i and the industrial revolution  this phenomenon  known as the great migration  brought more than seven million african americans to the north  harlem  the black mecca housing executives planned to create neighborhoods in harlem designed specifically for white workers who wanted to commute into the city  developers grew overambitious  however  and housing grew more rapidly than the transportation necessary to bring residents into the downtown area  the once exclusive district was abandoned by the white middle class  and frustrated developers were forced to cope with lower purchase prices than they first anticipated  white harlem landlords started selling their properties to black real estate agents such as philip a  payton  john e  nail  and henry c  parker  they also began renting directly to black tenants  meanwhile  the re development and gentrification of midtown pushed many blacks out of the metropolitan area  as a result  african americans began moving to harlem en masse  between      and      the number of blacks in the new york city neighborhood doubled  by the time the planned subway system and roadways reached harlem  many of the country s best and brightest black advocates  artists  entrepreneurs  and intellectuals had situated themselves in harlem  they brought with them not only the institutions and businesses necessary to support themselves  but a vast array of talents and ambitions  the area soon became known as  the black mecca  and  the capital of black america   the harlem renaissance during the early     s  the burgeoning african american middle class began pushing a new political agenda that advocated racial equality  the epicenter of this movement was in new york  where three of the largest civil rights groups established their headquarters  black historian  sociologist  and harvard scholar  w  e  b  du bois was at the forefront of the civil rights movement at this time  in      du bois  in collaboration with a group of prominent african american political activists and white civil rights workers  met in new york to discuss the challenges facing the black community  in       the group founded the national association for the advancement of colored people  naacp   to promote civil rights and fight african american disenfranchisement  at this same time  the jamaican born marcus garvey began his promotion of the  back to africa movement   garvey founded the universal negro improvement association and african communities league  unia acl   which advocated the reuniting of all people of african ancestry into one community with one absolute government  the movement not only encouraged african americans to come together  but to also feel pride in their heritage and race  the national urban league  nul  also came into being in the early   th century  founded by ruth standish baldwin and dr  george edmund haynes  the fledgling organization counseled black migrants from the south  trained black social workers  and worked to give educational and employment opportunities to blacks  together  these groups helped to establish a sense of community and empowerment for african americans not only in new york  but also around the country  in addition  they provided a rare opportunity for whites to collaborate with black intellectuals  social activists  educators  and artists in an attempt to transform a largely segregated and racist american society  instead of using more direct political means to achieve their goals  african american civil rights activists employed the artists and writers of their culture to work for the goals of civil rights and equality  jazz music  african american fine art  and black literature were all absorbed into mainstream culture  bringing attention to a previously disenfranchised segment of the american population  this blossoming of african american culture in european american society  particularly in the worlds of art and music  became known as the harlem renaissance  culture comes together one of the first notable events of the renaissance came shortly after the nul began publishing opportunity  a journal of negro life  believing that art and literature could lift african americans out of their situation  the magazine s editor  charles s  johnson  began printing promising black writers in each issue  during johnson s work for opportunity  he met jessie fauset   the literary editor for du bois  naacp magazine  crisis  fauset told johnson about her first novel  there is confusion         a story about middle class black women  in       johnson organized the first civic club dinner  which was planned as a release party for fauset s book  the party was an instant success  and served as a forum for emerging african american artists to meet wealthy white patrons  the party managed to launch the careers of several promising black writers  including poets langston hughes and countee cullen   in       shortly after the success of the civic club dinner  the magazine survey graphic  produced an issue on harlem  edited by black philosopher and howard university professor  alain locke   the magazine featured work by prominent black writers of the time period  the magazine published work by writers cullen  hughes and fauset  as well as poet claude mckay and novelist jean toomer   later that year  locke expanded the special issue into an anthology called the new negro  the collection fueled america s growing interest in african american writers  pushing black artists to the literary forefront  african american fine artists such as aaron douglas and charles alston also got their start through alain locke and charles johnson  who started publishing the artists  works as illustrations and cover art  pulled into the spotlight  these fine artists used their fame as an opportunity to delve into the themes they found problematic to american culture  by introducing the  exoticizing  of africa and notions of  the primitive  to white america  african american artists had their first opportunity to explore how these ideas could be used for and against their race  the jazz age with the conclusion of wwi came an end to wartime frugality and conservation  in an era of peace  americans experienced an economic boom  as well as a change in social morays  nicknamed  the roaring   s  for its dynamic changes  the decade became known for its celebration of excess and its rejection of wartime ideologies  americans also began investing more time and money in leisure activities and artistic endeavors  around this same time  congress ratified the prohibition act  while the amendment did not ban the actual consumption of alcohol  it made obtaining it legally difficult  liquor serving nightclubs  called  speakeasies  developed during this time as a way to allow americans to socialize  indulge in alcohol consumption  and rebel against the traditional culture  one of the best speakeasies in harlem was the cotton club  a place that intended to have the look and feel of a luxurious southern plantation  to complete the theme  only african american entertainers could perform there  while only white clientele  with few exceptions  were allowed to patronize the establishment  this attracted high powered celebrity visitors such as cole porter   bing crosby and doris duke to see the most talented black entertainers of the day  some of the most famous jazz performers of the time   including singer lena horne   composer and musician duke ellington   and singer cab calloway   graced the cotton club stage  attending clubs in harlem allowed whites from new york and its surrounding areas to indulge in two taboos simultaneously  to drink  as well as mingle with blacks  jazz musicians often performed in these clubs  exposing white clientele to what was typically an african american form of musical entertainment  as jazz hit the mainstream  many members of older generations began associating the raucous behavior of young people of the decade with jazz music  they started referring to the   s  along with its new dance styles and racy fashions  as  the jazz age   the end of the renaissance as the   s came to a close  so did white america s infatuation with harlem  and the artistic and intellectual movements surrounding it  the advent of the great depression also crushed the wild enthusiasm of  the roaring   s   bringing an end to the decadence and indulgence that fueled the patronage of harlem artists and their establishments  the depression hit the african american segment of the population hard  layoffs and housing foreclosures shut many blacks out of the american dream that previously seemed so close at hand  the increased economic tension of the depression caused black leaders to shift their focus from arts and culture to the financial and social issues of the time  in addition  the strained relationship between the black community and the white shop owners in harlem finally tore the two groups apart in       that alienation was expressed in the harlem riot of       the nation s first modem race riot  the resulting violence finally shattered the notion of harlem as the  mecca  for african americans  and broke the fleeting truce between white and black america  while the renaissance as a historical movement was over  the effects it had on modern society were far from finished  the artistic and political movements of the   s would live on in american culture in the form of new musical expression  award winning writing and  most importantly  the civil rights movement of the   s and   s  these events  and the role harlem would continue to play after the renaissance  would change the american cultural landscape forever  \n",

            "    the time meddler and so it begins  gallifrey begins to emerge into the doctor who mythos  ready to take it s grand place alongside other significant who staples  at last the noble race of time lords can stand revealed as we learn just where the doctor came from  except we don t  don t worry  we will  gallifrey  as rassilon proclaimed not long ago  will rise  but the time meddler is more akin to a sneak peek and the monk a rather less than sterling example of gallifrey s finest  but i m getting ahead of myself  we open on a rather sinister looking clock ticking away  it s obviously an attempt at foreshadowing  but it just doesn t quite work for me  it puts me more in mind of the opening of back to the future  what is effective is the shot of the doctor standing over the tardis controls as if he s just left bad wolf bay  even without knowing what has gone before you can tell just looking at william hartnell that he s suffered some kind of loss  vicki is kind enough to bring us up to speed by discussing the recent departure of ian and barbara  it s quite easy to dismiss the importance of this event nearly half a century later  but their departure left hartnell as the only remaining cast member from the opening episode  in a moment that sadly doesn t seem to have set a precedent the doctor freely admits to being saddened by their departure  this isn t yet the gallivanting alien who picks up and deposits passengers like a interdimensional taxi driver  this is a man who is hurt enough by his abandonment to let it show and it s quite disconcerting   we may land in their time one day and be able to discuss old times   we know they won t  even once the doctor finally learns to fly the tardis we know that he seldom revisits old friendships outside of sarah jane and the brig  but it leaves the door open nicely for ian and barbara to return and for the audience to not feel they re gone forever  as luck would have it just as vicki and the doctor are bemoaning their lack of company they hear what they presume to be a dalek wondering round the tardis  it turns out instead to be steven taylor  played by peter purves   yes him from crufts  rather than jack davenport  whist steven recovers with his cuddly panda  i m not joking  the tardis materialises on a beach  observed by a lone monk   he seems intrigued about the tardis  but not overly shocked  almost as if he knows more than he should  the first time i saw the time meddler i was genuinely intrigued about the monk  after all the internet had yet to spoil most of the series for me  i d imagine that most of you reading this review know fine well that the monk is in fact a time lord  no  ah  spoilers  should have said  in the tardis steven is being given a guided tour of his new home  the highlights for me include the horizontal control and  a chair with a panda on it   the tour concludes with the doctor making a request of the new companion   please stop buggering me   meanwhile  back in the tardis steven is being given a guided tour of his new home  the highlights for me include the horizontal control and  a chair with a panda on it   the tour concludes with the doctor making a request of the new companion   please stop buggering me   it s safe to presume from vicki s face that this wasn t the intended line  however i can state with absolute certainty that whatever was initially scripted wasn t nearly as amusing  steven s disbelief is somewhat refreshing  no polite disbelief or incredulous looks for him  as far as he s concerned this old man is off his rocker  but he takes it in good humour and continues to gently mock the doctor for the rest of the episode  indeed his mock interrogation of the doctor s story leads to details of the craft being given within ear shot of the monk s hearing  it s at this point i had to remind myself that this was made in the   s  it s early days for the show s mythos and there is absolutely no reason that the doctor should be able to sense the monk just because he could sense the master in his tenth body  we re reminded  quite forcibly  that a lot of the show s continuity was cobbled together as it went along and that there was just no way the writers could anticipate their scripts having to conform to rules that wouldn t exist as we know them for decades to come  but i digress  as night falls on our crew it casts an eerie shadow over proceedings  that is until you hear the wildlife sounds cranked up just a little too much  i m still trying to decide if it was a plot point or not  the night shots are beautifully realised  just as well really as the sun sets in this serial more times than it would in a michael bay film  still  it looks the part  the doctor informs the fourth wall that he misses having a history teacher as a companion  he s not alone  not if it means we re spared such painful conversations  after wandering off from his companions the doctor tries to casually ascertain the year from a local stopping just short of asking what the year actually is  he later informs the fourth wall that he misses having a history teacher as a companion  he s not alone  not if it means we re spared such painful conversations  the monks chanting that the doctor then overhears sounds suspiciously like a bad recording  so much so that when the chanting speed suddenly varies like a tape being chewed it takes me a few moments to realise that it s a plot point rather than a prop failure  although curiously the chanting is revealed as originating on a gramophone player  possibly high technology at the time of broadcast  being a child of the late   s i can only guess  but it certainly isn t a tape   the first episode ends with the doctor being trapped by the monk  we ll skip the second episode entirely as it feels very much like filler  probably due to the absence of the doctor for the duration of it  when we finally catch up with him  the doctor is casually discussing his escape with a local  given his later fear and disdain of his fellow time lords he seems remarkably unconcerned about the monk  continuity tinted glasses again i guess  these same glasses muddy the waters somewhat when it comes to judging the monk  on one hand he s seen healing the wounded and sick with penicillin  something quite doctor like  and then we see him consulting his eight point plan for villainy  seriously  he has an actual plan on a pull down chart   position atomic canon  followed by  sight vikings  gives you an idea of just how well thought out his plan is  but the monk isn t the highlight of this episode  it s the doctor himself  the time off seems to have worked wonders for hartnell and he returns in sparkling form and seems to relish taking on the monk  a shame then that the monk fails to live up to any kind of challenge  having said that  their dialogue in the last episode gives us our first glimpse of where these time lords have come from   you know as well as i do the golden rule about space and time travelling   never  never interfere with the course of history    who says so   asks the monk and the thought occurs that his dialogue wouldn t be out of place spoken by the fourth doctor and to prove the point he finishes with  it s more fun my way   as the monk rattles off his list of achievements to date you can t help but agree with him   then when he mentions his hand in building stonehenge you begin to wonder just who it was that built the pandorica for the alliance  continuity tinted glasses again and if you watch this episode wearing them then you can t help but be struck by the sheer hypocrisy of the doctor  throughout this story the doctor acts more like the time lords he s running from rather than the free spirit he s set to become  but when you consider that he only seems to be fifty years away from gallifrey according to the monk then it s really not that surprising he s still holding on to some of the basic tenets that he was raised with  his final solution of trapping the monk on earth without a functioning tardis actually works better with the continuity glasses as it eerily foreshadows the pertwee era  speaking of the monk s tardis  it s reveal at the end of episode   must have been truly staggering at it s first showing  no one knew anything of where the doctor came from and to discover one of his own kind half way through an historical must have been staggering for the audience of the time  ultimately the time meddler works best for what it implies rather than what it shows  the monk isn t anything close to a match for the doctor despite superior equipment and could never be the master in my mind  regardless of what some fan theories have suggested  however through his dialogue with the doctor we learn an awful lot about where they came from and just who the doctor might have been before we met him  and this wouldn t be the last time we met a time lord  indeed  we might even meet this particular time lord again    i ll leave you with the highlight for me though  an exchange between vicki and steven discussing the implications of meddling with time   memories will change  we re told  it s an explanation for every continuity error made during the fifty year run given  for all intents and purposes  at the very start of the run  yet people still get upset when some things don t match up perfectly between episodes  about the author alasdair shaw dabbled in who throughout the   s  but didn t really get into it properly until       his sense of timing has not improved over the years  he s a third generation who fan as well as a father of two  his wife has a bad feeling about those two facts  when not working as a lab technician or writing for kasterborous alasdair runs the doctor who reprint society for which he writes in print and dangling threads  he s a big fan of the valeyard  but that s neither here nor there  he has never worked for unit and is not related to dr liz shaw  we were so excited when we saw the inside of the monk s tardis  it s difficult to explain how magical the tardis control room was  it was the santuary  the place of safety that could be maddeningly out of reach  that is why the cliff hanger in the web planet where the tardis was apparently lost worked so well for us     there is absolutely no reason that the doctor should be able to sense the monk just because he could sense the master in his tenth body     maybe the dr other time lords can only sense the presence of high ranking time lords  perhaps the monk just doesn t cut it  interestingly  the dr later senses the presence of the presumed dead morbius  when he s being drugged via the glass of wine at solon s castle  i enjoyed reading this  as  though i think you mean  basic tenets he was raised with  rather than  tenants   but i like the idea of the monk growing up with flatmates  i remember at the time i first saw this in the early      s on bbc  thinking the implied rape of edith was totally unsuitable for a children s programme and totlaly out of the keep of the rest of the story  i still think that  but as edith seems to get over it very quickly i will too  i was really impressed with the cliffhanger for part three though and peter butterworth is really good throughout the story  i loved the target novelizations of the hartnell stories in the eighties  but being too young to have watched the stories on tv i had to imagine what those years looked like   which was the magic of those books  they made us create our own vision of doctor who  and this demand on my imagination got me even more hooked on the show   but until i recently sat down and carefully watched every hartnell adventure  i hadn t appreciated just how good peter purves was  right from the start  he was a reliable foil for the doctor  and he gives the time meddler a solid  human core  his anger at the end of the massacre is the most believable dramatic moment of the hartnell years  i d have loved to see him hang around longer to be a straight man to troughton  the monk could have been the master  but of course it was never intended  i like to think that the monk was hartnell s functional equivalent of the master  except like many doctor who concepts  such as the doctor at the time  he was unfinished and very much prototypical  unlike troughton s war chief  if you ve ever seen the war games you ll know what i mean   the same    s master that was in the king s demons you mean  a basic rehash of the same story you just reviewed  c mon  even the monk would facepalm the master s sloppy execution in that story  i can t see why you d be baffled by the idea that someone would like to use their imagination  so what if someone likes the idea that the monk was the master  it s not a crime  i simply expressed both the monk and the war chief s functional equivalency to the master  i could go as far as to say sherlock holmes and moriarty s relationship was functionally similar to the third doctor and the master  as was intended by the production team  doesn t mean i think they are all the same character  i was going by your opening comment   the monk could of been the master   i m all for linking continuities and histories together  as long as there is some logic and substance presented with the argument  apart from being time lords that the doctor has fought i can t see a single connection  i ve not seen the king s demons  but a quick glance through a synopsis reveals the master s plan to be a little more thought out than the monk s one  that s the beauty of it  a connection or a pattern is always in the eye of the beholder  but from a production point of view  they ll always be seperate characters  unless some future producer decides to highlight the issue  as for king s demons  well i guess you ll just have to give it a spin  one of the master s best wigs  and possibly his worst plan yet  still fun to watch though what is interesting is that at the end of episode    of the daleks master plan the doctor strands the monk on an ice planet and the monk s last ever words if we accept your reasoning  are  i ll get you for this doctor  i ll get you one day   in  terror of the autons   the master s supposed  first  appearance  a time lord comes to warn the doctor that  an old acquaintance has arrived on this planet  and that he  has learnt a great deal since you last met him   the original script also noted that  the master  was a new alias  and that the doctor had ruined one of  the master  s schemes  and that  the master  was out for revenge  the doctor is unimpressed  that jackanapes  all hes does is cause trouble   he states and later  i refuse to be worried by a renegade like the master  he s a  he s an unimaginative plodder   it is only when he sees that  the master  has indeed learnt a great deal since they last met that he takes the threat seriously  and we know that when they last met the master could not have been in his delgado incarnation when the doctor fails to recognise the voice on the telephone  then there s the fact that the monk was always going on about his  master plan   or the fact that the time lord specifically states that the master scored higher marks in science than the doctor  the monk was able to fix his faulty chameleon circuit which the doctor never did   and escape from      in a tardis with a shrunken interior  it makes no sense he would never come after the doctor again  and where was the doctor s prior to autons  meeting with the master  the master of logopolis is reckless like

As much as we love a 30-yard-screamer or a derby day thumping, we also love to indulge in a spot of match-day whining. As good as a match-day is, it just wouldn't be the same without finding something to kick-off about. No matter how well your team have performed, be it the extortionate Yorkie bar that has forced you to break into a fiver, to your teams' right-back's insistence on wearing gloves in August, we simply love to whine. But for some fans, a bit of harmless complaining resembles so much more than a simple bit of fun- it is a way of life. Indeed, for this bunch, the whining is incessant, the fickleness is in abundance and their unworldly levels of expectation simply will never be satisfied. In no particular order, here is an over the top, over exaggerative, completely unbalanced yet painfully true take on ten of the whiniest fans in English football. \n",
            "NA NE\t0355982\tFerry consultation needs deeper questions, says advocate A transportation advocacy group is circulating a list of 100 questions aimed at broadening the British Columbia government's consultation on coastal ferry services. \"Every aspect of the ferry system has to be looked at and the data has to be complete,\" said Gregg Dow, the president of the BC Coastal Transportation Society. \"We just demonstrated how complicated it is. It's a disservice of the provincial government not to bring that into the decision making process.\" The provincial government is at the start of a $700,000 consultation process Transportation Minister Mary Polak launched in late October aimed at cutting $26 million from BC Ferries' budget. Through a request for proposals process to run the consultation, the transportation ministry hired Kirk & Co. Consulting Ltd. in August. Elections BC records show Kirk & Co. has been a regular donor to the BC Liberal Party. The company has given nearly $12,000 to the governing party since 2005, and principal Judy Kirk has also made personal donations to the Liberals. Materials circulated as part of the consultation process look at the cost of each route, its capacity and how much it is used. There are many other factors that come into play, including regulations around things like crewing levels, transportation of dangerous goods and weight allowances, said Dow. \"What impacts will it have on the economies of these communities? Has the governemnt even looked at that?\" Many of the questions focus on how BC Ferries and the government calculated the capacity that they say is under used. The full list is available on the BCCTS website . Here are 12 of them: Has the Government/BC Ferries undertaken an evaluation of what constitutes 'Core Ferry Service'? It appears the Government is prepared to adjust Core Ferry Services downward in response to BC Ferries' escalating cost overruns. At what point does the Government determine Core Ferry Services will have bottomed out? Is the Government aware if any of the costs of the new BC Ferries Head Office has been allocated out to the fleet? Is the Government aware if any of the costs of the BC Ferries Vacation Centre have allocated out to the fleet? How have the two boards of directors expenses been allocated to the fleet, since 2003? When BC Ferries replaces vessels on Route 1, exchanging a Spirit Class Vessel with a Super C, they've reduced the capacity for those sailings. Did the Province review and account for the differences in capacity between vessels? Do BC Ferries' policies around on time performance -- specifically in how it determines how the vessels are to be loaded, cut-off times, and the handling of traffic in the terminals -- ultimately defeat its ability to meet maximum capacity utilization targets? Has the Government considered reductions to Management Bonus Plans to reduce drain on the fare and subsidy revenue at BCFS and thus protect farepayers and taxpayers interests? How does BC Ferries' Reservations policy affect capacity? Has the Government/BC Ferries determined if it is a deterrent to travel for some potential passengers? Has the Government evaluated what impact the loss of Tourism BC for three years had on ridership at BC Ferries? A large percentage of the loss posted to each route comprises the cost of central management, the cost of ship refits and terminal upgrades, and the cost of financing and amortization of BCF's $1.4 billion dollar debt. In what way will deep cuts to service reduce these expenses? In 2002, the Government promised improved service and predictable fares. The current consultation process the Government is undertaking demonstrates the business model isn't working. At what point does the government go back to the legislation and fix it? Andrew MacLeod is The Tyee's Legislative Bureau Chief in Victoria. Find him on Twitter or reach him here . Illahie If ferries is actually a private corporation If ferries is actually a private corporation, who gives a hoot whether they made a bad deal with government, and lose money as a result? If Exon or some other public company were to lose money would our provincial government try to help out. If ferries is actually government, then the operation should be treated like government. If the costs of maintaining our highways were to go up, the government would fund the increased costs of maintaining our roads. If the provincial government wants to get ferries back in the black, all they have to do is take back the 1.3 billion or so in debt that was wracked up David Hahn during his tenure. The interest payments on the Hahn debt is causing ferries to lose money. Dave50 Gulf island ferries BC Ferries does not want to touch the huge hog trough pay raises and bonuses to their executives.Total cost of 'management' should be 10% of operations ... I'll bet its nearly half the cost of personnel and not needed. When the liberal government hands you money and you have a monopoly you should balance the books every time.The BC liberal government is directly 100% responsible for the bad shape of BC ferries.The BC liberals paid ex BC ferries CEO David Hahn more than the prime minster and all, the admiral in the navy combined.Why would someone choose to move to the gulf island , then whine and cry about the ferry service.If you choose to live on the gulf island then get out your wallet, or buy a boat and commute back and forth.Half the trips are running a less than 1/4 capacity.Some living in a million dollar gulf island waterfront house trying to commute daily back and forth should not be totally subsidized by the taxpayer.Blame the BC liberal,Bc ferries paid David Hahn more than a 5 star adimral in the USA navy for running a 36 ship fleet which could be run out of a one room office.David hahn 48,000 a month pension benifit is what the Bc fiberl pay 70 people at 700.00 a month. But the actual blame for this must be laid squarely at the feet of those in Victoriathe BC Fiberals whom we elected to be the guardians of the public trust. If our politicians are willing to pay Hahn more than the Prime Minister and the Premier of BC combined, they're the ones who are to blame for this absolute travesty Ex Bc ferries liberal appointee David Hahn make more in a month pension benefits, than a full time employee working 40 ours or more a week makes in a year, and the every single honest taxpayer in BC has to pay . virimpig BCFerries The total ineptitude of the BCFerries management is a joke! And all this kerfluffle about cutting costs is a prelude to unloading the albatross back to the Dept. of Highways or Transportartion (or whatever Christy's women's auxiliary running this province until next spring calls it) so that it can be handled efficiently without the atronomical levels of management and salaries at FleetHouse!

But he lacked the composure of his team-mates and already some are starting to question whether the 9.6million signing from Montpellier can have the impact Wenger demands. The Gunners chief believes it is far too early to make negative judgements. And Wenger claimed his battle with Martin Skrtel will prove to be a valuable part of an important learning process. \"I am confident about him,\" said Wenger. \"Giroud is in an adaptation period. He has shown he is ready for a fight and I am sure he will adapt to the intensity of an English striker. \"Against Skrtel he discovered what the Premier League is all about.\" Here's a reminder of what Giroud can achieve in front of goal... Wenger is on much safer ground considering the merits of Abou Diaby. The 26-year-old's qualities have never been questioned. Far more of an issue are the numerous injury problems he has encountered. Diaby was restricted to just four Premier League appearances last term, all as a substitute. However, in the wake of Alex Song's departure, Diaby is more important than ever to the Arsenal cause. Alou Diaby: the new Vieira? Andrew Powell His superb performance at Liverpool was reminiscent of Patrick Vieira in his pomp. Now Wenger just needs the France midfielder to stay healthy. \"If he is fit and healthy, Diaby has the talent,\" said Wenger. \"You can see he is massive for us because he has everything you would want in a midfielder. \"I stood behind him because I know he is not only a fantastic player but a fantastic guy as well. \"He hasn't played for a year but now he looks in good shape. \"There is more to come but let's touch wood and hope it goes well in the next two or three weeks because he is going away with the national team. \n",
            "NA IN HA\t0008510\tElizabethan Science and Technology Elizabethan Period and Elizabethan Science and Technology THE SCIENTIFIC RENAISSANCE The Middle Ages were not by any means ignorant of science, but its study naturally received a great impetus when the Renaissance brought before educated men all that the Greeks and Romans had done in mathematics, physics, astronomy, medicine, and other subjects. The invention of printing also fostered the scientific revival by making it easy to spread knowledge abroad in every land. The pioneers of Renaissance science were Italians, but students in France, England, Germany, and other countries soon took up the work of enlightenment. COPERNICUS 1473-1543 The names of some Renaissance scientists stand as landmarks in the history of thought. The first place must be given to Copernicus, the founder of modern astronomy. He was a Pole, but lived many years in Italy. Patient study and calculation led him to the conclusion that the earth turns upon its own axis, and, together with the planets, revolves around the sun. The book in which he announced this conclusion did not appear until the very end of his life. A copy of it reached him on his deathbed. THE COPERNICAN THEORY Medieval astronomers had generally accepted the Ptolemaic system. Some students before Copernicus had indeed suggested that the earth and planets might rotate about a central sun, but he first gave reasons for such a belief. The new theory met much opposition, not only in the universities, which clung to the time-honored Ptolemaic system, but also among theologians, who thought that it contradicted many statements in the Bible. Moreover, people could not easily reconcile themselves to the idea that the earth, instead of being the center of the universe, is only one member of the solar system, that it is, in fact, only a mere speck of cosmic dust. GALILEO, 1564-1642 An Italian scientist, Galileo, made one of the first telescopes--it was about as powerful as an opera glass--and turned it on the heavenly bodies with wonderful results. He found the sun moving unmistakably on its axis, Venus showing phases according to her position in relation to the sun, Jupiter accompanied by revolving moons, or satellites, and the Milky Way composed of a multitude of separate stars. Galileo rightly believed that these discoveries confirmed the theory of Copernicus. KEPLER, 1571-1630 Another man of genius, the German Kepler, worked out the mathematical laws which govern the movements of the planets. He made it clear that the planets revolve around sun in elliptical instead of circular orbits. Kepler's investigations afterwards led to the discovery of the principle of gravitation. VESALIUS, 1514-1564 AND HARVEY, 1578-1657 Two other scientists did epochal work in a field far removed from astronomy. Vesalius, a Fleming, who studied in Italian medical schools, gave to the world the first careful description of the human body based on actual dissection. He was thus the founder of human anatomy. Harvey, an Englishman, after observing living animals, announced the discovery of the circulation of the blood. He thereby founded human physiology. THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Vesalius, Harvey, and their fellow workers built up the scientific method. In the Middle Ages students had mostly been satisfied to accept what Aristotle and other philosophers had said, without trying to prove their statements. Kepler, for instance, was the first to disprove the Aristotelian idea that, as all perfect motion is circular, therefore the heavenly bodies must move in circular orbits. Similarly, the world had to wait many centuries before Harvey showed Aristotle's error in supposing that the blood arose in the liver, went thence to the heart, and by the veins was conducted over the body. The new scientific method rested on observation and experiment. Students learned at length to take nothing for granted, to set aside all authority, and to go straight to nature for their facts. As Lord Bacon, one of Shakespeare's contemporaries and a severe critic of the old scholasticism, declared, \"All depends on keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature, and so receiving their images simply as they are, for God forbid that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of the world.\" Modern science, to which we owe so much, is a product of the Renaissance.

            "NA NE\t3337703\tThe value of NYC housing construction starts more than doubled to $1.9 billion in the first half of 2012, hitting a four-year high. In contrast, the value of overall construction starts in the city dropped 16 percent year-over-year, according to a New York Building Congress report released Tuesday. McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge data shows that there were $6.6 billion worth of starts across all construction for the first six months this year, down from $7.9 billion for the same period in 2011. Building Congress president Richard Anderson attributed the dip in overall construction to the non-residential sector, which includes commercial office and retail buildings, public and private schools and cultural/entertainment venues. The value of started projects in this sector fell to $3.2 billion in the first half of 2012 after hitting $6.1 billion in the same six months the previous year. \"While there's no shortage of planned projects, especially in the office sector, we are lacking the type of job growth and confidence in the overall economy that is necessary to get these projects off the ground quickly,\" Anderson said in a statement. However, \"the numbers coming from the residential sector are very encouraging... If you go back to July of 2011, this sector has generated nearly $4 billion in new projects.\" The data covers all project starts in New York City, including new construction, alterations and renovations to existing structures. The numbers reflect the estimated value of each commenced project through the whole construction process. \n",
            "NA PB\t0274411\tSearch Have you guys been keeping up with the Tumblr page for Postcards from America ? Its been fun to see all of the posts and the difference in the work. In the middle of all of this, Sandy happened, and Gilles Peress made a detour to cover the aftermath. See more, here . Its the last day to back Per-Anders Pettersson s project, Soweto , so lets get on this. The rewards for backers are fantastic (a weekend workshop in Soweto with Per-Anders sounds amazing, but a signed print would be a nice compromise if you can't figure out how to get to South Africa right now). Soweto was recently featured on the Lens Blog . Soweto, or southwestern townships, was founded over one hundred years ago outside Johannesburg, South Africa, under British authority. It was established as the first settlement for black and colored people on the outskirts of the city. During that time Africans had been drawn to work on the gold mines near Johannesburg and were accommodated in separate areas on the outskirts of town. The growth of the township of Soweto was accelerated by the increasing eviction of Africans by city and state authorities under the Apartheid regime after 1948. Soweto grewto be the biggest township in the country. Far away from work and housing, the township consisted of hostels for men, simple huts and corrugated tin shacks. Today, Soweto is a development hub and consists of 32 townships and the official population is around one million. Many believe it's much higher, some think as high as 2-3 million. I worked in Soweto for the first time in 1994 while covering the first democratic elections. Soweto has always been my favorite part of Johannesburg. Soweto as a rich history and is infamous for the political violence during the Apartheid struggle. Of those the violent student uprisings in 1976 are maybe most known to foreigners, where students from the township rose up in protest against Afrikaans as the only language used in the education system. The South African regime answered to the protests by shooting at unarmed children dressed in their school uniforms. This event sparked a re-awakening of black resistance and many of the important developments at the time happened in the township. Many of the key players in the struggle era lived and operated out of Soweto. More than 30 years later Soweto is a city of growing enterprises and a wild mix of culture, with several high-end shopping malls, a brand new world class theater, car dealers, parks, improving transport and brand new townhouses and apartments that sell like hot cakes. I have been based in South Africa for the last 10 years and have always gone back to Soweto whenever I could on assignments or to see friends. I am fascinated with his fast changing pace and its growing prosperity. I am now planning to move to Soweto for a couple of months to complete my ongoing project about the rapid changes in South Africa's most famous township. Soweto is seen by many as a model of hope for the new South Africa. It is no longer a place of doom and gloom but a place of hope. It has of course its problems with high levels of poverty, unemployment and crime, but the positive developments are beginning to filter through. The few last years have brought a lot of investments to Soweto and many people now enjoy modern shopping malls, banks, restaurants and trendy bars. Many of the old shacks have been erased and thousands of small government subsidized houses have been built. Because of new investments, many residents of Soweto now start to spend most of their time and money in the township. Most of them still work in Johannesburg, but now they don't have to buy groceries and bring them back in mini bus taxis. More and more people have their own cars and buy everything close to their homes. Soweto has lately been in the midst of a property boom, where every property for sale has several potential buyers and it's usually sold within days. Many newly rich blacks left the township in the 90s for the northern suburbs, where traditionally only affluent whites lived. Many live there in mansions with high walls and tight security. Many only know their neighbors by name. It has been a difficult adjustment for most. Added problems are the high crime rate in affluent suburbs, such as hour breaking and car high-jacking. Many who left miss the vibrant life in the townships and they usually came back to visit on the weekends for family gatherings and funerals, or they just come to wash their new BMWs at a car wash, while having a few beers with their childhood friends in tendy bars. Soweto is increasingly a source for new fashion, art, music styles in South Africa. It is a great microcosm to show the many facets of the new South Africa. I would be very happy to share this journey with you! For serious supporters of this project I will offer a workshop in Soweto where we will live, work and breath in this massive, vibrant place closely. We will also work on a photo project and you will also be able to get a close and unique insight into how I work as a photojournalist. We will be completing projects and I will share my insight and experience of many years of working as a photojournalist around the world. -- Per-Anders Pettersson What started your interest in photography and what led you to photo editing? Well, I kinda fell into it. I dropped out of college and moved to New York, I was working a series of crappy food service jobs. A friend from high school was working at the Saba Agency in the library, refiling slides. I was working at a burrito joint working the takeout counter. I was miserable. When my pal decided to leave his job at Saba to be a waiter and I asked if he could get me in. He marched me into Marcel Saba's office and said \"I'm leaving, but my friend can work here.\" Marcel, surprisingly, said okay. I started refiling 35mm slides, then moved onto cataloguing, then editing, then helping out with production. I loved my job, loved looking at photos. I learned a lot working there with really great, talented people. When People magazine went published a photo of Audrey Hepburn that I researched, I was thrilled! My first job in publishing was with Marianne Butler at Worth . When she left for Men's Health , she took me with her. She really taught me a lot, she had a great eye and was a very exacting boss. Her photo pet peeves are now my pet peeves. I shudder at the word \"shooter\" and cropped out feet makes me crazy. What are some of the best, and hardest aspects of your job? Seeing a great photo is the best part of the job. I love being surprised, I love seeing a story/ portrait turn out different and better than I imagined. The hardest part is when the photo is just okay. All I can hear is that Debbie Downer sound when a shoot is less than expected. So basically its always Christmas. The main wall of Ernie's office. About the wall, Ernie says \"It's a mix of photo/images/people i like, my family and 2 percent cute boys.\" I'm sure you get tons of printed promos, emails and phone calls; what is the best way for a photographer to reach out to you and what are some common mistakes that are made? I don't get as many printed promos pieces anymore. When I do receive one that catches my eye, I'll always check the photographer's website. I do get lots of e-promos and generally just scan the embedded image and make a choice whether to click to the website. I'm more likely to check out the websites of photographer's outside of big cities. I do see a lot of great young photographers whose images are not appropriate for the work I produce -- that can be hard! I will sometimes send an email to let them know how much I admire their work. Promo mistakes... sigh... Always include your location! Photo editors need to know where you are located. If you are a regional photographer your promo should show a wider variety of images, i.e. portraits, reportage... I tend to pass over promo pieces with one image of: landscapes, puppies, children, flowers, a celebrity holding a puppy or a flower... When you get a shoot in, what is your editing process? Do you go by your gut reaction to an image or is your edit based on the text or what your editor has asked for? When a shoot comes in I just go through and make a selects of photos that I like, and then try to strong arm the designers into using the photo that I like best! We work very closely with our editors on the art direction so when the shoot happens all the edit notes have been incorporated into the shoot direction. Photograph by Meredith Jenks Ernie Monteiro started working in photo in the waning days of the age of chrome. She has worked at Worth, Men's Health and is currently at Time Inc. Content Solutions, the custom publishing arm of Time Inc. The amazing Stephen Wilkes will be featured on one of my favorite shows, CBS Sunday Morning (why yes, I am an 85-year-old-gentleman, and proud of it!) this weekend. The focus will be on his Day to Night series and the making of the photographs. If you are lazing about in your pajamas be sure to watch it, Stephen is pretty incredible and inspiring, I can't wait to see it! Aside from photography, were there any other professions that interested you? I started out with the desire to be a computer scientist. Then I explored city planning.  I discovered photography while I was in college, and was inspired to finally find an appropriate tool to simultaneously illustrate the complexities of society and the intricacies of being a human.  I am challenged by the desire to illustrate a clear picture that intertwines both emotion and reality into a method of communication that is understood.  I saw images by Dorthea Lange and felt that images she created were more significant than most anything else in illustrating the dilemma in the U.S. during the Dust Bowl; photography could be a significant and powerful communication tool in society. How influential and beautiful a profession to be able to introduce that level of conversation to the world. Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Can you tell me more about your project The Middle Road Which you worked on during the last election. What gave you the idea, how long did you spend shooting and are you curious to revisit those spots again and see if those candidate signs have changed? I'm actually writing this from the road. I left the west coast to follow the same route as I did in 2008 to explore and add depth to the project.  This time I'll be photographing this route twice -- to NY and back.   The interesting twist this time is Sandy. Sandy is the deadly weather event that cancelled my flight east at the beginning of this project, and created havoc for just about everyone on the east coast.  I was supposed to land in Newark on October 28th, the night before the hurricane reached landfall there.  For a while I was unsure if this project was doomed or if there was still a way to make it happen within the limited time available before the election on November 6th, or if the project mattered _at all_ in the scheme of things.  But, here we are, on the road- Day 7 will take us in and out of post-Sandy New York City. The trip in 2008 was a little bit spontaneous.  I came up with the concept when driving from Las Vegas to the Bay Area in late summer 2008 after spotting a Ron Paul sign alongside the freeway in the desert.  The sparseness of the landscape with this sign plopped in the middle; it seemed so insignificant- this name, this sign, politics against the backdrop of the desert sun.  Simultaneously, the radio was underlining the importance of each candidate and how this election was different.  Friends were excitedly arguing about politics. I felt buried beneath this big political bubble and sensed a disconnect signaled by this Ron Paul sign beneath a bright blue sky; the sign almost looked like a piece of garbage left there.  I passed by it once more with the intention of photographing it, and discovered the challenges that came along with photographing signs along a busy freeway. I never got a shot.  But I thought that photographing signs related directly to the two major candidates throughout the United States would make an interesting story if I was able to explore multiple signs in multiple places.  Adding to the depth, stick to a main corridor that divides the country in two -- kind of the way politics seems to divide people into the us and the them; the haves and the have-nots; the right and the left; the rich and the poor; the right and the wrong. There are all these dualities, and then there's the middle road. Several weeks went by and I didn't share my idea with anyone.  Surprisingly, a close friend of mine called me up out of the blue; she had bought a house across the country in Upstate New York to escape the Bay Area for a while. She would be moving sometime in October and needed a driving partner.  Our explorations and teamwork during that trip created the images from 2008.  I wasn't sure how it was going to work out, and then I got the film back. There's something special about photographing the country in the way that I did during that time.  It's a different time now, though it's still quite a powerful time- with much confusion and disappointment and strife.  I feel like this part of the story was missing from 2008. I don't intend to photograph any elections in the future. The 2012 images serve as a bookend to the 2008 images. Interestingly, we are all driven to see similarities or differences in the settings for each sign; we are drawn to trying to find a pattern. Are the signs for the Republican candidate all in rich neighborhoods or on farms? Sometimes.  Is the Democratic sign in front of the working family's little house? Sometimes.  From the road, it is hard to notice a pattern other than the obvious increase in Democratic signage in metropolitan areas.  That is the single noticeable pattern.  All else is unpredictable in terms of the signs that I am looking for. I don't keep numbers, I'm just looking for good photographs. I'm looking for a wide breadth of things that tie in classic American stories, images that illustrate the American landscape on a variety of levels, images that bring me back to that disconnect introduced by the Ron Paul sign in the desert. \n",
            "NA NE\t1419275\tAlthough official inflation in Argentina ranges 11.5%, private estimates from advisory economic and financial groups as well as market operators support estimates above 25% ...and climbing. Labour contracts, even when the unionized workers confederation is a close ally of the Kirchner administration have been agreed on a 25% inflation floor. Cabinet chief Anibal Fernandez said he could not agree with Economy minister Amado Boudou when he recently stated that the increase of the consumer prices index only really affects part of the society: the upper middle-class. \"I don't agree with that, normally it's the other way around\" said Fernandez who admitted that it is precisely in the lower fixed income brackets where inflation \"most impacts\", particularly in food and beverage items \"where we are seeing the most significant increases\". The inflation issue had already been addressed by Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo, who had focused the matter in beef prices, a staple for Argentine consumers. The cabinet chief however went further. According to Fernandez the problem is not with the government but with the entrepreneurs, a similar hypothesis to that developed by minister Randazzo during a press barrage on radio and television interviews. \"It's not Indec (Statistics Office) that increases prices. Those who produce goods increase prices, and we are not going to defend those people\", said Fernandez in support of the much controversial data from Indec and putting the blame on private businesses. But business organizations reacted and the Argentine Industrial Union, UIA, the main manufacturers organization and lobby claimed the government focus was \"simplistic and the easy-way out of the problem, blame thy neighbour\". \"You can't correct inflation unless you begin by admitting you have a problem\", said UIA president Hector Mendez. More sarcastic UIA Vice president Ignacio de Mendiguren said that \"these are the same entrepreneurs from the time of former president Nestor Kirchner when inflation was only 5%\". \"That inflation (private estimates) does not exist. Those who increase prices are business leaders. I'm not saying that beef has not increased, maybe it's a conspiration\", insisted Anibal Fernandez. \"The 25% inflation is non existent. It's only sustained in public statements by private interests. I know what is spent at home and in the homes of the needy. That is why we are working to change conditions, but the task is not magic\", he added. \"We admit prices have increased but don't bill it on us, look out for those who up the prices\", insisted Fernandez in his attack on entrepreneurs.

            "NA NE\t0551841\tMedia Reaction to Newsweek's Obama 'The First Gay President' Cover This week's Newsweek declared Obama 'the first gay president.' From arguments that President James Buchanan was actually the first, to complaints about 'the first ... president' clichs, we rounded up some of the best -- and harshest -- feedback on the cover. Before President Obama had even announced his support for same-sex marriage , Newsweek was expected to do something drastic. Time magazine's cover , featuring a mother breastfeeding her 3-year-old, stirred speculation over what Newsweek , having presumably cornered the market on controversial magazine covers, would do to one-up its competitor. A Newsweek spokesman even confirmed that after editor Tina Brown saw the Time cover, she laughed and said , \"Let the games begin.\" Sure enough, Brown and the rest of the Newsweek editors were able to come up with an idea that created just as much, if not more, controversy -- and discussion -- as Time 's: a cover featuring an image of Obama with a rainbow halo over his head, above the headline \"The First Gay President.\" Poynter argues that \" Newsweek 's cover is provocative, fun to riff about, and a flag in the ground that says print journalism still matters. Kinda makes you hope the games continue, doesn't?\" Jewel Samad / AFP / Getty Images 1. Jim Loewen at Salon Loewen disagrees with Newsweek 's cover story, arguing that Obama is not the United States' first gay president. Not only is he not gay, we've already had a gay president: James Buchanan, he writes. \"There can be no doubt that James Buchanan was gay, before, during, and after his four years in the White House. Moreover, the nation knew it too -- he was not far into the closet,\" Loewen writes, pointing to letters between Buchanan and a friend in which he laments the move of his lover to Paris. \"I have gone a wooing to several gentleman, but have not succeeded with any one of them,\" reads the quote from Buchanan's letter. \"I feel that it is not good for a man to be alone; and should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick, provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection.\" Loewen argues that the reason Americans don't name Buchanan as our first gay president \"is that we have a touching belief in progress ... Buchanan could not have been gay then, else we would not seem more tolerant now.\" 2. Eric Randall at The Atlantic Wire As Andrew Sullivan himself acknowledged , the headline for his cover essay was not intended to be understood literally. Newsweek was not attempting to \"out\" Obama but rather was making a play on Toni Morrison calling President Bill Clinton \"the first black president.\" But Randall points out that this isn't the first time that reference has been made. Obama has twice been called the first woman president: first in 2008, by Newsweek 's Martin Linsky , and then again by The Washington Post 's Kathleen Parker in 2010. The argument in both cases was that Obama's wisdom, values, and management style were similar to that of a female leader. In 2009 the Associated Foreign Press asked if Obama was the first Asian-American president while, the same year, Geraldo Rivera suggested he might be the first Hispanic president. Then, in 2011, New York magazine declared him  the first Jewish president. \"Expectations were high that editor Tina Brown would do something typically attention-grabbing to mark this occasion, but this effort seems, well, clich,\" Randall writes . \"It wasn't going to be long before someone outed our first black, female, Jewish, Hispanic, Asian-American president as gay.\" 3. Rick Klein at ABC News While the \"first ____ president\" trope has been used before, never has \"gay\" been the fill-in word. And, as Klein points out , the significance of the cover lies in the fact that such an image of the Democratic president isn't a terrifying thing for the party. \"A move that any previous Republican candidate for president would have seen as a rainbow-wrapped gift has been met haltingly by the GOP's standard bearer,\" he writes. Instead, \"the president has shifted on a major cultural issue where, polling suggests, demographics are on his side, if not necessarily politics. And the campaign has seen another week elapse where the Obama economy was not front and center.\" 4. Brad Knickerbocker at The Christian Science Monitor \"Is Obama the 'first gay president'?\" Knickerbocker asks . More important, will it matter for the election? No, he suggests, citing several arguments that the excitement over Obama's change of opinion on gay marriage does not eclipse economic concerns that seem to drive votes. \"According to a new Associated Press-GfK poll, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the economy, and handling it remains President Barack Obama's weak spot and biggest challenge in his bid for a second term,\" writes Knickerbocker. So perhaps the Newsweek cover's biggest issue is its focus on a position of the president's that is of little significance to the election. 5. Twitter The surest sign of controversy is whether it consumes the Twitterverse, and on Monday, Twitter was all over this week's Newsweek cover. Our favorite tweets disregard the president and ask what the first lady thinks about all this. @Indecision wrote , \"Michelle Obama is going to flip when she sees that Newsweek cover,\" and the Dennis Miller Show joked , \"re Newsweek cover Wouldn't Michelle tell you he's the first Bi-President?\" 6. Press Secretary Jay Carney Amid all the speculation, analysis, and reaction surrounding the cover, what does the man himself think about being adorned with a rainbow halo and dubbed \"the first gay president\"? We're not quite sure. On Monday morning, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney dodged questions about how the president reacted to the Newsweek cover, saying he wasn't sure if Obama had seen it. ANTE UP Proud Half Step In a major policy shift Wednesday, President Obama told ABC News's Robin Roberts that 'same-sex couples should be able to get married.' The move marked the first time a sitting president has thrown his support behind gay marriage and the end of Obama's self-described 'evolution' on the issue. \n",
            "NA NE\t0620606\tIDFA '12: Pushing the boundaries As the 25th edition of IDFA kicks off in Amsterdam today, realscreen examines the exceptional recent crop of films focusing on the Israel/Palestine conflict, and looks at how filmmakers and execs in the region are moving the conversation forward. Among critics, commissioners, filmmakers and festival programmers, a consensus is emerging of 2012 as a breakout year for documentaries dealing with the Israel/Palestine conflict. While most years tend to see at least one strong doc dealing with the decades-long Middle Eastern discord, this year has seen the emergence of at least five, with The Gatekeepers (pictured above), 5 Broken Cameras , The Law in These Parts , State 194 and A World Not Ours all making significant waves on the international festival circuit. These films have not only been seen as the cream of the crop in their subgenre, but have also become some of the most acclaimed docs of the year. 5 Broken Cameras , for example, has picked up more than 20 festival prizes so far, including the World Cinema Documentary Directing prize at Sundance, two IDFA awards, and trophies from Sheffield Doc/Fest, Traverse City and Cinema du Reel. Meanwhile, The Law in These Parts -- which sees members of Israel's military legal corps frankly discussing developments in the Occupied Territories since Israel conquered the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967 -- picked up the Sundance Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema Documentary, as well as prizes from Hot Docs, Full Frame and the Jerusalem International Film Festival (JIFF). \"There's no question to me that a lot of the basic 'This is the situation' films have been made, and now you're looking to deepen the conversation and deepen the questions, and reveal the broader complexity,\" says Alesia Weston (pictured below), executive director of the Jerusalem Film Center (JFC), which organizes JIFF. Weston, who earlier this year left the Sundance Institute's Feature Film Program to take on the role at the JFC, adds that an overabundance of films on the conflict is driving the stakes for innovation higher for filmmakers. \"It does become a bit about whether this issue is something we've seen 25 times already, and whether it adds anything to the conversation,\" she says. It was this idea of saturation that originally led Guy Davidi, one of 5 Broken Cameras ' two directors, to reject co-director Emad Burnat's original request to help him make a documentary about life under occupation in the Palestinian village of Bil'in. \"I told him I didn't see a reason to do another film about the non-violent movement, because others were doing that,\" Davidi explains. \"There was Bil'in My Love in 2006, and there was Budrus , which was being produced at that time. So I said to him, 'I don't think so.'\" Davidi was also wary of the fact that he, as an Israeli, might find it difficult to work with Burnat, a Palestinian, on account of both logistics and external perceptions. \"It's not an easy kind of collaboration,\" he says. \"Of course it looks good when you present it, but it's very challenging. First of all I would always be in a role where I'm a professional filmmaker and he's not, so just to be able to work together and speak the same language is very difficult. \"Emad is a villager basically, he's never signed a contract in his life. Then again, I'm in a weak position because, being an Israeli, I'd always be in a position where I'll be judged on whether I'm exploiting him. With everything that would happen in our work together, I would be 'The Israeli Guy.' That's not an easy position to put yourself in.\" Nevertheless, after giving the project consideration and convincing Burnat (pictured above, right) to make himself central to the film's storyline, Davidi (pictured left) realized the appeal of 5 Broken Cameras ' longitudinal nature, with considerable potential for footage shot over a five-year period. (Also falling into the longitudinal category is Mahdi Fleifel's A World Not Ours , which was shot over many years at a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. The doc picked up three top awards at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival in October, after premiering in Toronto a month earlier.) Davidi says he also became attracted to the idea of working in a role that would entirely support a Palestinian narrative. \"It would be politically more interesting for me to collaborate with Emad in a role where I empower his voice; in one way it would be more challenging personally, because my ego would be completely reduced,\" he explains. \"He's the face of the film, he's telling his story, and it's his footage. It wasn't easy for me to accept, but I was there to empower his voice. \"And politically that's very interesting also, because a lot of Israeli films use the occupation of Palestine to talk about themselves -- to talk about their problems, even to talk about their guilt; to accuse themselves. But even when it's criticizing, it's still dealing with ourselves. Whereas with this film, I'm there to serve [Burnat's] voice.\" The Law in These Parts and The Gatekeepers , two of the year's best conflict docs from Israeli directors, definitely -- and unashamedly -- fall into the self-analyzing category described by Davidi. The latter was quickly acquired by Sony Pictures Classics after premiering at JIFF, and played for the first time in North America at Telluride this fall, winning rave reviews. Between Colorado and its official screening at TIFF a few days later, the doc picked up major Oscar buzz, with press on both U.S. coasts now considering it a contender for the Academy Award for best documentary feature. The Gatekeepers consists primarily of interviews with six former heads of the Shin Bet -- Israel's foremost intelligence and security agency -- all of whom have never been interviewed before on screen. Blending high-end CGI and archival footage to powerful effect, the former spymasters talk about their roles in Israel's decades-long counter-terrorism campaign, discussing their methods and decisions, and reflecting on whether the ends ultimately justified the means. Topics on the table include torture, terror, assassination and collateral damage, but what makes the doc so compelling is the frankness with which the subjects speak. The film, made with a budget of more than _1 million (US$1.29 million) for Israel's Channel 1 (which will air it as a five-part series) owes a lot stylistically to Errol Morris's landmark doc The Fog of War , which Gatekeepers director Dror Moreh (pictured below) described as being \"a textbook\" for his film. The filmmaker spent between 12 and 15 hours with each interviewee, grilling them about their tenures as heads of the organization. \"I had a few researchers who would prepare at least 70 or 80 pages of bio for me for each one of them, which I read very carefully,\" Moreh explains. \"Sometimes I had 20 pages of questions -- so I knew from the beginning how I would conduct the interviews. \"But I knew also that I wanted them to take place in an environment where they would feel very comfortable. So I tried to do it in their homes or offices, and though the interviews were on green-screen, I brought the green-screen to their houses.\" Moreh says that culling such a huge amount of footage into a lean, 95-minute feature was the most difficult task of the whole process. \"I left my kidney, my heart, my hands and a lot of my organs on the editing room floor,\" he jokes. \"There were a lot of things that went out that were amazing, but at the end of the day I wanted to reach a wider audience. And I think the fact that I knew that I could do five chapters for Israeli television acted as a release mechanism, to allow me to give up a lot of the stories which I thought were essential for the movie.\" The other key challenge for the filmmaker, when dealing with so much interview footage, was ensuring he conveyed each subject's views in as fair and balanced a fashion as possible. \"It was very important for me also to not manipulate what they say, because I have a lot of power,\" offers Moreh. \"I could've manipulated their words very easily. But I didn't want to create a context that was not something they believe or support.\" That said, Moreh does not believe that it is possible for a filmmaker to make a doc without inputting his or her own point of view. \"Every time someone holds a camera and interviews someone, he puts his point of view in,\" he offers. \"Even a newsreel has a point of view. Someone tries to tell you that he's bringing both sides, but I've never believed that. Every documentary has a very strong point of view behind it, and definitely I came to this film with a point of view which I wanted to emphasize.\" Indeed, despite the success of many of this year's best Israel/Palestine docs, controversy never tends to be far away. And the most frequent criticisms tend to regard balance, fairness and neutrality -- something difficult to achieve with documentaries at the best of times. Despite the fact that criticism of Israel's role in the Occupied Territories in The Gatekeepers comes entirely from top-level Israelis, the film still drew fire from some audience members at the Toronto International Film Festival, with one exasperated viewer at a post-screening Q&A asking Moreh when someone was \"finally going to make a film offering the Israeli point of view.\" Passions run high, but as far as Weston is concerned, JIFF's role -- and to a certain degree that of most film festivals -- is simply to pick the best films available in any given year. When programming a controversial doc, \"I don't find myself going, 'Oh God, we have to go and find another opposing view,'\" she says. \"We program the best of what's out there; it's not our job to say, 'We need a pro-Palestinian [film], a pro-Israel, a pro-left wing or pro-right wing...' I don't feel that responsibility.\" Cinephil MD Philippa Kowarsky (pictured above) agrees that the notion of balance is not an important consideration for her. As head of the Tel Aviv-based distributor, she sees plenty of docs on the Israel/Palestine conflict each year. But to make the cut for her indie's small slate, docs have to be exceptional, which for her is \"something that couldn't have been made five year ago -- it has to be relevant, current and different in its form for 2012, 2013 and 2014.\" Cinephil is handling distribution of The Gatekeepers (on which Kowarsky is also a producer) outside of North America, as well as Dan Setton's State 194 (pictured below), which follows Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's quest to have Palestine recognized by the United Nations as an independent state. While balance is not a key concern for her, Kowarsky says her own views on the conflict do very much influence the kinds of films she would pick up for distribution. \"I would never sell a film, even if it was brilliant, if I didn't agree with it ideologically,\" she says. \"I wouldn't take a film that I felt was too right-wing. How could I sit and persuade someone to buy a film that I didn't believe in? If I can't relate to the premise and I don't believe in it, I can't sell it. I don't feel I owe anyone in the world a balanced slate.\" Looking to the future, the probability of resolution -- twin state or otherwise -- to the ongoing conflict appears remote at present, which means there will likely be many more Israel/Palestine docs to come. Nevertheless, there is a palpable sense that documentaries about the ongoing struggle are evolving. \"The conflict is a little bit like a stage right now, where we know the actors, we know what is happening -- and the film community has seen so many films about the subject,\" offers Davidi. \"So now it's about what kind of thing we can do with the known players, which makes for a very different approach to documentary. As filmmakers, we have to be more creative and find new ways to shape the story, with new strategies, understandings and ideas.\" The Gatekeepers plays at IDFA in Amsterdam on November 17, 19, 20, 21 and 23 \n",

It's just training camp though, so I'm not going to blow up any cars just yet. So, obviously, training camp has started and this city is slowly starting to buzz with hockey fever. The first preseason game is Thursday (the first game was last night, first televised game is Toronto's first game on Wednesday on TSN2), but Montreal fans won't be left thirsty, as 5 games in 5 nights is sure to quench our thurst for hockey, for the time being. The new players seem to be adapting well to life in this city. Some players, like Gionta and Gomez, as well as Subban, have already started to learn French. Which begs the question, are they truly trying to embrace the culture in Quebec, or are they lobbying both the organization and the fans in order to obtain, oh, I don't know... the captaincy? With news coming out that the captaincy had been offered to Andrei Markov, and that he turned the opportunity to wear the C down, the race for the captaincy is wide open. With no clear-cut frontrunner, and a bunch of new players, it could be almost anyone who will end up donning the C when the season starts. For all we know, it could be no one donning the C on October 1st in Toronto. Personally, that doesn't bother me. The media will be all up in arms if that does happen, quoting tradition and referring to the past and how this team has always had a captain who's led the team, but I say, let the players EARN the captaincy. At the ranch retreat at the end of the month, Jacques Martin and his team of coaches should identify the player who performed best during camp... both on the ice and off. The player who best represents what it takes to wear a Captain's C (minus Andrei Markov, who seems to be more focused on playing hockey than learning new languages). Then, give that player the C on an interim basis for the Month of October. Once that month is up, give the C to the best performer from that prior month (again, both on and off the ice). Keep doing this until the right player finally steps up, and you have yourself a captain. The rotating captaincy concept has worked on many teams in many different sports, and why shouldn't it work here? Tradition or not, you don't want to hastily award the C to someone who might not deserve it, and with several players seemingly interested, and seemingly in this city long term, management should take a long, hard look on who deserves to wear it. Once again, I stress that this player should fit the role, both on and off the ice, and not just because he's the best or loudest player on the ice, OR because he seems to be willing to learn french or visit hospitals and set up charities. This player should have it all. But if I had to choose one player, right now, who will make or break this team's success over the next few years, and who I think would be a good fit as captain? Who do YOU think should wear the C? Any ideas on how it should be handed out? Should we even start the season with the captain, or let it decide itself as the season goes on? Please, comment, and please, enjoy the site! Update 2PM: According to RDS, Markov has denied being offered the C. maybe something's being lost in translation, or maybe management is trying to keep it hush, but it's certainly interesting. \n"

            "The Top TEN 'Whiniest Sets of Fans' in English Football The art of moaning is almost intrinsically built within us as football fans. As much as we love a 30-yard-screamer or a derby day thumping, we also love to indulge in a spot of match-day whining. As good as a match-day is, it just wouldn't be the same without finding something to kick-off about. No matter how well your team have performed, be it the extortionate Yorkie bar that has forced you to break into a fiver, to your teams' right-back's insistence on wearing gloves in August, we simply love to whine. But for some fans, a bit of harmless complaining resembles so much more than a simple bit of fun- it is a way of life. Indeed, for this bunch, the whining is incessant, the fickleness is in abundance and their unworldly levels of expectation simply will never be satisfied. In no particular order, here is an over the top, over exaggerative, completely unbalanced yet painfully true take on ten of the whiniest fans in English football. \n",
            "Ferry consultation needs deeper questions, says advocate A transportation advocacy group is circulating a list of 100 questions aimed at broadening the British Columbia government's consultation on coastal ferry services. \"Every aspect of the ferry system has to be looked at and the data has to be complete,\" said Gregg Dow, the president of the BC Coastal Transportation Society. \"We just demonstrated how complicated it is. It's a disservice of the provincial government not to bring that into the decision making process.\" The provincial government is at the start of a $700,000 consultation process Transportation Minister Mary Polak launched in late October aimed at cutting $26 million from BC Ferries' budget. Through a request for proposals process to run the consultation, the transportation ministry hired Kirk & Co. Consulting Ltd. in August. Elections BC records show Kirk & Co. has been a regular donor to the BC Liberal Party. The company has given nearly $12,000 to the governing party since 2005, and principal Judy Kirk has also made personal donations to the Liberals. Materials circulated as part of the consultation process look at the cost of each route, its capacity and how much it is used. There are many other factors that come into play, including regulations around things like crewing levels, transportation of dangerous goods and weight allowances, said Dow. \"What impacts will it have on the economies of these communities? Has the governemnt even looked at that?\" Many of the questions focus on how BC Ferries and the government calculated the capacity that they say is under used. The full list is available on the BCCTS website . Here are 12 of them: Has the Government/BC Ferries undertaken an evaluation of what constitutes 'Core Ferry Service'? It appears the Government is prepared to adjust Core Ferry Services downward in response to BC Ferries' escalating cost overruns. At what point does the Government determine Core Ferry Services will have bottomed out? Is the Government aware if any of the costs of the new BC Ferries Head Office has been allocated out to the fleet? Is the Government aware if any of the costs of the BC Ferries Vacation Centre have allocated out to the fleet? How have the two boards of directors expenses been allocated to the fleet, since 2003? When BC Ferries replaces vessels on Route 1, exchanging a Spirit Class Vessel with a Super C, they've reduced the capacity for those sailings. Did the Province review and account for the differences in capacity between vessels? Do BC Ferries' policies around on time performance -- specifically in how it determines how the vessels are to be loaded, cut-off times, and the handling of traffic in the terminals -- ultimately defeat its ability to meet maximum capacity utilization targets? Has the Government considered reductions to Management Bonus Plans to reduce drain on the fare and subsidy revenue at BCFS and thus protect farepayers and taxpayers interests? How does BC Ferries' Reservations policy affect capacity? Has the Government/BC Ferries determined if it is a deterrent to travel for some potential passengers? Has the Government evaluated what impact the loss of Tourism BC for three years had on ridership at BC Ferries? A large percentage of the loss posted to each route comprises the cost of central management, the cost of ship refits and terminal upgrades, and the cost of financing and amortization of BCF's $1.4 billion dollar debt. In what way will deep cuts to service reduce these expenses? In 2002, the Government promised improved service and predictable fares. The current consultation process the Government is undertaking demonstrates the business model isn't working. At what point does the government go back to the legislation and fix it? Andrew MacLeod is The Tyee's Legislative Bureau Chief in Victoria. Find him on Twitter or reach him here . Illahie If ferries is actually a private corporation If ferries is actually a private corporation, who gives a hoot whether they made a bad deal with government, and lose money as a result? If Exon or some other public company were to lose money would our provincial government try to help out. If ferries is actually government, then the operation should be treated like government. If the costs of maintaining our highways were to go up, the government would fund the increased costs of maintaining our roads. If the provincial government wants to get ferries back in the black, all they have to do is take back the 1.3 billion or so in debt that was wracked up David Hahn during his tenure. The interest payments on the Hahn debt is causing ferries to lose money. Dave50 Gulf island ferries BC Ferries does not want to touch the huge hog trough pay raises and bonuses to their executives.Total cost of 'management' should be 10% of operations ... I'll bet its nearly half the cost of personnel and not needed. When the liberal government hands you money and you have a monopoly you should balance the books every time.The BC liberal government is directly 100% responsible for the bad shape of BC ferries.The BC liberals paid ex BC ferries CEO David Hahn more than the prime minster and all, the admiral in the navy combined.Why would someone choose to move to the gulf island , then whine and cry about the ferry service.If you choose to live on the gulf island then get out your wallet, or buy a boat and commute back and forth.Half the trips are running a less than 1/4 capacity.Some living in a million dollar gulf island waterfront house trying to commute daily back and forth should not be totally subsidized by the taxpayer.Blame the BC liberal,Bc ferries paid David Hahn more than a 5 star adimral in the USA navy for running a 36 ship fleet which could be run out of a one room office.David hahn 48,000 a month pension benifit is what the Bc fiberl pay 70 people at 700.00 a month. But the actual blame for this must be laid squarely at the feet of those in Victoriathe BC Fiberals whom we elected to be the guardians of the public trust. If our politicians are willing to pay Hahn more than the Prime Minister and the Premier of BC combined, they're the ones who are to blame for this absolute travesty Ex Bc ferries liberal appointee David Hahn make more in a month pension benefits, than a full time employee working 40 ours or more a week makes in a year, and the every single honest taxpayer in BC has to pay . virimpig BCFerries The total ineptitude of the BCFerries management is a joke! And all this kerfluffle about cutting costs is a prelude to unloading the albatross back to the Dept. of Highways or Transportartion (or whatever Christy's women's auxiliary running this province until next spring calls it) so that it can be handled efficiently without the atronomical levels of management and salaries at FleetHouse!

            "The 25-year-old did have chances at Anfield. But he lacked the composure of his team-mates and already some are starting to question whether the 9.6million signing from Montpellier can have the impact Wenger demands. The Gunners chief believes it is far too early to make negative judgements. And Wenger claimed his battle with Martin Skrtel will prove to be a valuable part of an important learning process. \"I am confident about him,\" said Wenger. \"Giroud is in an adaptation period. He has shown he is ready for a fight and I am sure he will adapt to the intensity of an English striker. \"Against Skrtel he discovered what the Premier League is all about.\" Here's a reminder of what Giroud can achieve in front of goal... Wenger is on much safer ground considering the merits of Abou Diaby. The 26-year-old's qualities have never been questioned. Far more of an issue are the numerous injury problems he has encountered. Diaby was restricted to just four Premier League appearances last term, all as a substitute. However, in the wake of Alex Song's departure, Diaby is more important than ever to the Arsenal cause. Alou Diaby: the new Vieira? Andrew Powell His superb performance at Liverpool was reminiscent of Patrick Vieira in his pomp. Now Wenger just needs the France midfielder to stay healthy. \"If he is fit and healthy, Diaby has the talent,\" said Wenger. \"You can see he is massive for us because he has everything you would want in a midfielder. \"I stood behind him because I know he is not only a fantastic player but a fantastic guy as well. \"He hasn't played for a year but now he looks in good shape. \"There is more to come but let's touch wood and hope it goes well in the next two or three weeks because he is going away with the national team. \n",
            "Elizabethan Science and Technology Elizabethan Period and Elizabethan Science and Technology THE SCIENTIFIC RENAISSANCE The Middle Ages were not by any means ignorant of science, but its study naturally received a great impetus when the Renaissance brought before educated men all that the Greeks and Romans had done in mathematics, physics, astronomy, medicine, and other subjects. The invention of printing also fostered the scientific revival by making it easy to spread knowledge abroad in every land. The pioneers of Renaissance science were Italians, but students in France, England, Germany, and other countries soon took up the work of enlightenment. COPERNICUS 1473-1543 The names of some Renaissance scientists stand as landmarks in the history of thought. The first place must be given to Copernicus, the founder of modern astronomy. He was a Pole, but lived many years in Italy. Patient study and calculation led him to the conclusion that the earth turns upon its own axis, and, together with the planets, revolves around the sun. The book in which he announced this conclusion did not appear until the very end of his life. A copy of it reached him on his deathbed. THE COPERNICAN THEORY Medieval astronomers had generally accepted the Ptolemaic system. Some students before Copernicus had indeed suggested that the earth and planets might rotate about a central sun, but he first gave reasons for such a belief. The new theory met much opposition, not only in the universities, which clung to the time-honored Ptolemaic system, but also among theologians, who thought that it contradicted many statements in the Bible. Moreover, people could not easily reconcile themselves to the idea that the earth, instead of being the center of the universe, is only one member of the solar system, that it is, in fact, only a mere speck of cosmic dust. GALILEO, 1564-1642 An Italian scientist, Galileo, made one of the first telescopes--it was about as powerful as an opera glass--and turned it on the heavenly bodies with wonderful results. He found the sun moving unmistakably on its axis, Venus showing phases according to her position in relation to the sun, Jupiter accompanied by revolving moons, or satellites, and the Milky Way composed of a multitude of separate stars. Galileo rightly believed that these discoveries confirmed the theory of Copernicus. KEPLER, 1571-1630 Another man of genius, the German Kepler, worked out the mathematical laws which govern the movements of the planets. He made it clear that the planets revolve around sun in elliptical instead of circular orbits. Kepler's investigations afterwards led to the discovery of the principle of gravitation. VESALIUS, 1514-1564 AND HARVEY, 1578-1657 Two other scientists did epochal work in a field far removed from astronomy. Vesalius, a Fleming, who studied in Italian medical schools, gave to the world the first careful description of the human body based on actual dissection. He was thus the founder of human anatomy. Harvey, an Englishman, after observing living animals, announced the discovery of the circulation of the blood. He thereby founded human physiology. THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Vesalius, Harvey, and their fellow workers built up the scientific method. In the Middle Ages students had mostly been satisfied to accept what Aristotle and other philosophers had said, without trying to prove their statements. Kepler, for instance, was the first to disprove the Aristotelian idea that, as all perfect motion is circular, therefore the heavenly bodies must move in circular orbits. Similarly, the world had to wait many centuries before Harvey showed Aristotle's error in supposing that the blood arose in the liver, went thence to the heart, and by the veins was conducted over the body. The new scientific method rested on observation and experiment. Students learned at length to take nothing for granted, to set aside all authority, and to go straight to nature for their facts. As Lord Bacon, one of Shakespeare's contemporaries and a severe critic of the old scholasticism, declared, \"All depends on keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature, and so receiving their images simply as they are, for God forbid that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of the world.\" Modern science, to which we owe so much, is a product of the Renaissance.

            "The value of NYC housing construction starts more than doubled to $1.9 billion in the first half of 2012, hitting a four-year high. In contrast, the value of overall construction starts in the city dropped 16 percent year-over-year, according to a New York Building Congress report released Tuesday. McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge data shows that there were $6.6 billion worth of starts across all construction for the first six months this year, down from $7.9 billion for the same period in 2011. Building Congress president Richard Anderson attributed the dip in overall construction to the non-residential sector, which includes commercial office and retail buildings, public and private schools and cultural/entertainment venues. The value of started projects in this sector fell to $3.2 billion in the first half of 2012 after hitting $6.1 billion in the same six months the previous year. \"While there's no shortage of planned projects, especially in the office sector, we are lacking the type of job growth and confidence in the overall economy that is necessary to get these projects off the ground quickly,\" Anderson said in a statement. However, \"the numbers coming from the residential sector are very encouraging... If you go back to July of 2011, this sector has generated nearly $4 billion in new projects.\" The data covers all project starts in New York City, including new construction, alterations and renovations to existing structures. The numbers reflect the estimated value of each commenced project through the whole construction process. \n",
            "Search Have you guys been keeping up with the Tumblr page for Postcards from America ? Its been fun to see all of the posts and the difference in the work. In the middle of all of this, Sandy happened, and Gilles Peress made a detour to cover the aftermath. See more, here . Its the last day to back Per-Anders Pettersson s project, Soweto , so lets get on this. The rewards for backers are fantastic (a weekend workshop in Soweto with Per-Anders sounds amazing, but a signed print would be a nice compromise if you can't figure out how to get to South Africa right now). Soweto was recently featured on the Lens Blog . Soweto, or southwestern townships, was founded over one hundred years ago outside Johannesburg, South Africa, under British authority. It was established as the first settlement for black and colored people on the outskirts of the city. During that time Africans had been drawn to work on the gold mines near Johannesburg and were accommodated in separate areas on the outskirts of town. The growth of the township of Soweto was accelerated by the increasing eviction of Africans by city and state authorities under the Apartheid regime after 1948. Soweto grewto be the biggest township in the country. Far away from work and housing, the township consisted of hostels for men, simple huts and corrugated tin shacks. Today, Soweto is a development hub and consists of 32 townships and the official population is around one million. Many believe it's much higher, some think as high as 2-3 million. I worked in Soweto for the first time in 1994 while covering the first democratic elections. Soweto has always been my favorite part of Johannesburg. Soweto as a rich history and is infamous for the political violence during the Apartheid struggle. Of those the violent student uprisings in 1976 are maybe most known to foreigners, where students from the township rose up in protest against Afrikaans as the only language used in the education system. The South African regime answered to the protests by shooting at unarmed children dressed in their school uniforms. This event sparked a re-awakening of black resistance and many of the important developments at the time happened in the township. Many of the key players in the struggle era lived and operated out of Soweto. More than 30 years later Soweto is a city of growing enterprises and a wild mix of culture, with several high-end shopping malls, a brand new world class theater, car dealers, parks, improving transport and brand new townhouses and apartments that sell like hot cakes. I have been based in South Africa for the last 10 years and have always gone back to Soweto whenever I could on assignments or to see friends. I am fascinated with his fast changing pace and its growing prosperity. I am now planning to move to Soweto for a couple of months to complete my ongoing project about the rapid changes in South Africa's most famous township. Soweto is seen by many as a model of hope for the new South Africa. It is no longer a place of doom and gloom but a place of hope. It has of course its problems with high levels of poverty, unemployment and crime, but the positive developments are beginning to filter through. The few last years have brought a lot of investments to Soweto and many people now enjoy modern shopping malls, banks, restaurants and trendy bars. Many of the old shacks have been erased and thousands of small government subsidized houses have been built. Because of new investments, many residents of Soweto now start to spend most of their time and money in the township. Most of them still work in Johannesburg, but now they don't have to buy groceries and bring them back in mini bus taxis. More and more people have their own cars and buy everything close to their homes. Soweto has lately been in the midst of a property boom, where every property for sale has several potential buyers and it's usually sold within days. Many newly rich blacks left the township in the 90s for the northern suburbs, where traditionally only affluent whites lived. Many live there in mansions with high walls and tight security. Many only know their neighbors by name. It has been a difficult adjustment for most. Added problems are the high crime rate in affluent suburbs, such as hour breaking and car high-jacking. Many who left miss the vibrant life in the townships and they usually came back to visit on the weekends for family gatherings and funerals, or they just come to wash their new BMWs at a car wash, while having a few beers with their childhood friends in tendy bars. Soweto is increasingly a source for new fashion, art, music styles in South Africa. It is a great microcosm to show the many facets of the new South Africa. I would be very happy to share this journey with you! For serious supporters of this project I will offer a workshop in Soweto where we will live, work and breath in this massive, vibrant place closely. We will also work on a photo project and you will also be able to get a close and unique insight into how I work as a photojournalist. We will be completing projects and I will share my insight and experience of many years of working as a photojournalist around the world. -- Per-Anders Pettersson What started your interest in photography and what led you to photo editing? Well, I kinda fell into it. I dropped out of college and moved to New York, I was working a series of crappy food service jobs. A friend from high school was working at the Saba Agency in the library, refiling slides. I was working at a burrito joint working the takeout counter. I was miserable. When my pal decided to leave his job at Saba to be a waiter and I asked if he could get me in. He marched me into Marcel Saba's office and said \"I'm leaving, but my friend can work here.\" Marcel, surprisingly, said okay. I started refiling 35mm slides, then moved onto cataloguing, then editing, then helping out with production. I loved my job, loved looking at photos. I learned a lot working there with really great, talented people. When People magazine went published a photo of Audrey Hepburn that I researched, I was thrilled! My first job in publishing was with Marianne Butler at Worth . When she left for Men's Health , she took me with her. She really taught me a lot, she had a great eye and was a very exacting boss. Her photo pet peeves are now my pet peeves. I shudder at the word \"shooter\" and cropped out feet makes me crazy. What are some of the best, and hardest aspects of your job? Seeing a great photo is the best part of the job. I love being surprised, I love seeing a story/ portrait turn out different and better than I imagined. The hardest part is when the photo is just okay. All I can hear is that Debbie Downer sound when a shoot is less than expected. So basically its always Christmas. The main wall of Ernie's office. About the wall, Ernie says \"It's a mix of photo/images/people i like, my family and 2 percent cute boys.\" I'm sure you get tons of printed promos, emails and phone calls; what is the best way for a photographer to reach out to you and what are some common mistakes that are made? I don't get as many printed promos pieces anymore. When I do receive one that catches my eye, I'll always check the photographer's website. I do get lots of e-promos and generally just scan the embedded image and make a choice whether to click to the website. I'm more likely to check out the websites of photographer's outside of big cities. I do see a lot of great young photographers whose images are not appropriate for the work I produce -- that can be hard! I will sometimes send an email to let them know how much I admire their work. Promo mistakes... sigh... Always include your location! Photo editors need to know where you are located. If you are a regional photographer your promo should show a wider variety of images, i.e. portraits, reportage... I tend to pass over promo pieces with one image of: landscapes, puppies, children, flowers, a celebrity holding a puppy or a flower... When you get a shoot in, what is your editing process? Do you go by your gut reaction to an image or is your edit based on the text or what your editor has asked for? When a shoot comes in I just go through and make a selects of photos that I like, and then try to strong arm the designers into using the photo that I like best! We work very closely with our editors on the art direction so when the shoot happens all the edit notes have been incorporated into the shoot direction. Photograph by Meredith Jenks Ernie Monteiro started working in photo in the waning days of the age of chrome. She has worked at Worth, Men's Health and is currently at Time Inc. Content Solutions, the custom publishing arm of Time Inc. The amazing Stephen Wilkes will be featured on one of my favorite shows, CBS Sunday Morning (why yes, I am an 85-year-old-gentleman, and proud of it!) this weekend. The focus will be on his Day to Night series and the making of the photographs. If you are lazing about in your pajamas be sure to watch it, Stephen is pretty incredible and inspiring, I can't wait to see it! Aside from photography, were there any other professions that interested you? I started out with the desire to be a computer scientist. Then I explored city planning.  I discovered photography while I was in college, and was inspired to finally find an appropriate tool to simultaneously illustrate the complexities of society and the intricacies of being a human.  I am challenged by the desire to illustrate a clear picture that intertwines both emotion and reality into a method of communication that is understood.  I saw images by Dorthea Lange and felt that images she created were more significant than most anything else in illustrating the dilemma in the U.S. during the Dust Bowl; photography could be a significant and powerful communication tool in society. How influential and beautiful a profession to be able to introduce that level of conversation to the world. Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Sarah Windels -- Speeding Through Here Can you tell me more about your project The Middle Road Which you worked on during the last election. What gave you the idea, how long did you spend shooting and are you curious to revisit those spots again and see if those candidate signs have changed? I'm actually writing this from the road. I left the west coast to follow the same route as I did in 2008 to explore and add depth to the project.  This time I'll be photographing this route twice -- to NY and back.   The interesting twist this time is Sandy. Sandy is the deadly weather event that cancelled my flight east at the beginning of this project, and created havoc for just about everyone on the east coast.  I was supposed to land in Newark on October 28th, the night before the hurricane reached landfall there.  For a while I was unsure if this project was doomed or if there was still a way to make it happen within the limited time available before the election on November 6th, or if the project mattered _at all_ in the scheme of things.  But, here we are, on the road- Day 7 will take us in and out of post-Sandy New York City. The trip in 2008 was a little bit spontaneous.  I came up with the concept when driving from Las Vegas to the Bay Area in late summer 2008 after spotting a Ron Paul sign alongside the freeway in the desert.  The sparseness of the landscape with this sign plopped in the middle; it seemed so insignificant- this name, this sign, politics against the backdrop of the desert sun.  Simultaneously, the radio was underlining the importance of each candidate and how this election was different.  Friends were excitedly arguing about politics. I felt buried beneath this big political bubble and sensed a disconnect signaled by this Ron Paul sign beneath a bright blue sky; the sign almost looked like a piece of garbage left there.  I passed by it once more with the intention of photographing it, and discovered the challenges that came along with photographing signs along a busy freeway. I never got a shot.  But I thought that photographing signs related directly to the two major candidates throughout the United States would make an interesting story if I was able to explore multiple signs in multiple places.  Adding to the depth, stick to a main corridor that divides the country in two -- kind of the way politics seems to divide people into the us and the them; the haves and the have-nots; the right and the left; the rich and the poor; the right and the wrong. There are all these dualities, and then there's the middle road. Several weeks went by and I didn't share my idea with anyone.  Surprisingly, a close friend of mine called me up out of the blue; she had bought a house across the country in Upstate New York to escape the Bay Area for a while. She would be moving sometime in October and needed a driving partner.  Our explorations and teamwork during that trip created the images from 2008.  I wasn't sure how it was going to work out, and then I got the film back. There's something special about photographing the country in the way that I did during that time.  It's a different time now, though it's still quite a powerful time- with much confusion and disappointment and strife.  I feel like this part of the story was missing from 2008. I don't intend to photograph any elections in the future. The 2012 images serve as a bookend to the 2008 images. Interestingly, we are all driven to see similarities or differences in the settings for each sign; we are drawn to trying to find a pattern. Are the signs for the Republican candidate all in rich neighborhoods or on farms? Sometimes.  Is the Democratic sign in front of the working family's little house? Sometimes.  From the road, it is hard to notice a pattern other than the obvious increase in Democratic signage in metropolitan areas.  That is the single noticeable pattern.  All else is unpredictable in terms of the signs that I am looking for. I don't keep numbers, I'm just looking for good photographs. I'm looking for a wide breadth of things that tie in classic American stories, images that illustrate the American landscape on a variety of levels, images that bring me back to that disconnect introduced by the Ron Paul sign in the desert. \n",
            "Although official inflation in Argentina ranges 11.5%, private estimates from advisory economic and financial groups as well as market operators support estimates above 25% ...and climbing. Labour contracts, even when the unionized workers confederation is a close ally of the Kirchner administration have been agreed on a 25% inflation floor. Cabinet chief Anibal Fernandez said he could not agree with Economy minister Amado Boudou when he recently stated that the increase of the consumer prices index only really affects part of the society: the upper middle-class. \"I don't agree with that, normally it's the other way around\" said Fernandez who admitted that it is precisely in the lower fixed income brackets where inflation \"most impacts\", particularly in food and beverage items \"where we are seeing the most significant increases\". The inflation issue had already been addressed by Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo, who had focused the matter in beef prices, a staple for Argentine consumers. The cabinet chief however went further. According to Fernandez the problem is not with the government but with the entrepreneurs, a similar hypothesis to that developed by minister Randazzo during a press barrage on radio and television interviews. \"It's not Indec (Statistics Office) that increases prices. Those who produce goods increase prices, and we are not going to defend those people\", said Fernandez in support of the much controversial data from Indec and putting the blame on private businesses. But business organizations reacted and the Argentine Industrial Union, UIA, the main manufacturers organization and lobby claimed the government focus was \"simplistic and the easy-way out of the problem, blame thy neighbour\". \"You can't correct inflation unless you begin by admitting you have a problem\", said UIA president Hector Mendez. More sarcastic UIA Vice president Ignacio de Mendiguren said that \"these are the same entrepreneurs from the time of former president Nestor Kirchner when inflation was only 5%\". \"That inflation (private estimates) does not exist. Those who increase prices are business leaders. I'm not saying that beef has not increased, maybe it's a conspiration\", insisted Anibal Fernandez. \"The 25% inflation is non existent. It's only sustained in public statements by private interests. I know what is spent at home and in the homes of the needy. That is why we are working to change conditions, but the task is not magic\", he added. \"We admit prices have increased but don't bill it on us, look out for those who up the prices\", insisted Fernandez in his attack on entrepreneurs.

Hmm maybe it's because there are at least 30% more pesos in circulation this year than there was last year! There will be lots more next year if CFK gets her budget. Gotta buy the election gotta print more pesos. This is going to spiral out of control it is just a matter of time. It will be ugly when it happens, no IMF or Paris Club to bail them out this time.

            "Media Reaction to Newsweek's Obama 'The First Gay President' Cover This week's Newsweek declared Obama 'the first gay president.' From arguments that President James Buchanan was actually the first, to complaints about 'the first ... president' clichs, we rounded up some of the best -- and harshest -- feedback on the cover. Before President Obama had even announced his support for same-sex marriage , Newsweek was expected to do something drastic. Time magazine's cover , featuring a mother breastfeeding her 3-year-old, stirred speculation over what Newsweek , having presumably cornered the market on controversial magazine covers, would do to one-up its competitor. A Newsweek spokesman even confirmed that after editor Tina Brown saw the Time cover, she laughed and said , \"Let the games begin.\" Sure enough, Brown and the rest of the Newsweek editors were able to come up with an idea that created just as much, if not more, controversy -- and discussion -- as Time 's: a cover featuring an image of Obama with a rainbow halo over his head, above the headline \"The First Gay President.\" Poynter argues that \" Newsweek 's cover is provocative, fun to riff about, and a flag in the ground that says print journalism still matters. Kinda makes you hope the games continue, doesn't?\" Jewel Samad / AFP / Getty Images 1. Jim Loewen at Salon Loewen disagrees with Newsweek 's cover story, arguing that Obama is not the United States' first gay president. Not only is he not gay, we've already had a gay president: James Buchanan, he writes. \"There can be no doubt that James Buchanan was gay, before, during, and after his four years in the White House. Moreover, the nation knew it too -- he was not far into the closet,\" Loewen writes, pointing to letters between Buchanan and a friend in which he laments the move of his lover to Paris. \"I have gone a wooing to several gentleman, but have not succeeded with any one of them,\" reads the quote from Buchanan's letter. \"I feel that it is not good for a man to be alone; and should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick, provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection.\" Loewen argues that the reason Americans don't name Buchanan as our first gay president \"is that we have a touching belief in progress ... Buchanan could not have been gay then, else we would not seem more tolerant now.\" 2. Eric Randall at The Atlantic Wire As Andrew Sullivan himself acknowledged , the headline for his cover essay was not intended to be understood literally. Newsweek was not attempting to \"out\" Obama but rather was making a play on Toni Morrison calling President Bill Clinton \"the first black president.\" But Randall points out that this isn't the first time that reference has been made. Obama has twice been called the first woman president: first in 2008, by Newsweek 's Martin Linsky , and then again by The Washington Post 's Kathleen Parker in 2010. The argument in both cases was that Obama's wisdom, values, and management style were similar to that of a female leader. In 2009 the Associated Foreign Press asked if Obama was the first Asian-American president while, the same year, Geraldo Rivera suggested he might be the first Hispanic president. Then, in 2011, New York magazine declared him  the first Jewish president. \"Expectations were high that editor Tina Brown would do something typically attention-grabbing to mark this occasion, but this effort seems, well, clich,\" Randall writes . \"It wasn't going to be long before someone outed our first black, female, Jewish, Hispanic, Asian-American president as gay.\" 3. Rick Klein at ABC News While the \"first ____ president\" trope has been used before, never has \"gay\" been the fill-in word. And, as Klein points out , the significance of the cover lies in the fact that such an image of the Democratic president isn't a terrifying thing for the party. \"A move that any previous Republican candidate for president would have seen as a rainbow-wrapped gift has been met haltingly by the GOP's standard bearer,\" he writes. Instead, \"the president has shifted on a major cultural issue where, polling suggests, demographics are on his side, if not necessarily politics. And the campaign has seen another week elapse where the Obama economy was not front and center.\" 4. Brad Knickerbocker at The Christian Science Monitor \"Is Obama the 'first gay president'?\" Knickerbocker asks . More important, will it matter for the election? No, he suggests, citing several arguments that the excitement over Obama's change of opinion on gay marriage does not eclipse economic concerns that seem to drive votes. \"According to a new Associated Press-GfK poll, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the economy, and handling it remains President Barack Obama's weak spot and biggest challenge in his bid for a second term,\" writes Knickerbocker. So perhaps the Newsweek cover's biggest issue is its focus on a position of the president's that is of little significance to the election. 5. Twitter The surest sign of controversy is whether it consumes the Twitterverse, and on Monday, Twitter was all over this week's Newsweek cover. Our favorite tweets disregard the president and ask what the first lady thinks about all this. @Indecision wrote , \"Michelle Obama is going to flip when she sees that Newsweek cover,\" and the Dennis Miller Show joked , \"re Newsweek cover Wouldn't Michelle tell you he's the first Bi-President?\" 6. Press Secretary Jay Carney Amid all the speculation, analysis, and reaction surrounding the cover, what does the man himself think about being adorned with a rainbow halo and dubbed \"the first gay president\"? We're not quite sure. On Monday morning, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney dodged questions about how the president reacted to the Newsweek cover, saying he wasn't sure if Obama had seen it. ANTE UP Proud Half Step In a major policy shift Wednesday, President Obama told ABC News's Robin Roberts that 'same-sex couples should be able to get married.' The move marked the first time a sitting president has thrown his support behind gay marriage and the end of Obama's self-described 'evolution' on the issue. \n",
            "IDFA '12: Pushing the boundaries As the 25th edition of IDFA kicks off in Amsterdam today, realscreen examines the exceptional recent crop of films focusing on the Israel/Palestine conflict, and looks at how filmmakers and execs in the region are moving the conversation forward. Among critics, commissioners, filmmakers and festival programmers, a consensus is emerging of 2012 as a breakout year for documentaries dealing with the Israel/Palestine conflict. While most years tend to see at least one strong doc dealing with the decades-long Middle Eastern discord, this year has seen the emergence of at least five, with The Gatekeepers (pictured above), 5 Broken Cameras , The Law in These Parts , State 194 and A World Not Ours all making significant waves on the international festival circuit. These films have not only been seen as the cream of the crop in their subgenre, but have also become some of the most acclaimed docs of the year. 5 Broken Cameras , for example, has picked up more than 20 festival prizes so far, including the World Cinema Documentary Directing prize at Sundance, two IDFA awards, and trophies from Sheffield Doc/Fest, Traverse City and Cinema du Reel. Meanwhile, The Law in These Parts -- which sees members of Israel's military legal corps frankly discussing developments in the Occupied Territories since Israel conquered the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967 -- picked up the Sundance Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema Documentary, as well as prizes from Hot Docs, Full Frame and the Jerusalem International Film Festival (JIFF). \"There's no question to me that a lot of the basic 'This is the situation' films have been made, and now you're looking to deepen the conversation and deepen the questions, and reveal the broader complexity,\" says Alesia Weston (pictured below), executive director of the Jerusalem Film Center (JFC), which organizes JIFF. Weston, who earlier this year left the Sundance Institute's Feature Film Program to take on the role at the JFC, adds that an overabundance of films on the conflict is driving the stakes for innovation higher for filmmakers. \"It does become a bit about whether this issue is something we've seen 25 times already, and whether it adds anything to the conversation,\" she says. It was this idea of saturation that originally led Guy Davidi, one of 5 Broken Cameras ' two directors, to reject co-director Emad Burnat's original request to help him make a documentary about life under occupation in the Palestinian village of Bil'in. \"I told him I didn't see a reason to do another film about the non-violent movement, because others were doing that,\" Davidi explains. \"There was Bil'in My Love in 2006, and there was Budrus , which was being produced at that time. So I said to him, 'I don't think so.'\" Davidi was also wary of the fact that he, as an Israeli, might find it difficult to work with Burnat, a Palestinian, on account of both logistics and external perceptions. \"It's not an easy kind of collaboration,\" he says. \"Of course it looks good when you present it, but it's very challenging. First of all I would always be in a role where I'm a professional filmmaker and he's not, so just to be able to work together and speak the same language is very difficult. \"Emad is a villager basically, he's never signed a contract in his life. Then again, I'm in a weak position because, being an Israeli, I'd always be in a position where I'll be judged on whether I'm exploiting him. With everything that would happen in our work together, I would be 'The Israeli Guy.' That's not an easy position to put yourself in.\" Nevertheless, after giving the project consideration and convincing Burnat (pictured above, right) to make himself central to the film's storyline, Davidi (pictured left) realized the appeal of 5 Broken Cameras ' longitudinal nature, with considerable potential for footage shot over a five-year period. (Also falling into the longitudinal category is Mahdi Fleifel's A World Not Ours , which was shot over many years at a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. The doc picked up three top awards at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival in October, after premiering in Toronto a month earlier.) Davidi says he also became attracted to the idea of working in a role that would entirely support a Palestinian narrative. \"It would be politically more interesting for me to collaborate with Emad in a role where I empower his voice; in one way it would be more challenging personally, because my ego would be completely reduced,\" he explains. \"He's the face of the film, he's telling his story, and it's his footage. It wasn't easy for me to accept, but I was there to empower his voice. \"And politically that's very interesting also, because a lot of Israeli films use the occupation of Palestine to talk about themselves -- to talk about their problems, even to talk about their guilt; to accuse themselves. But even when it's criticizing, it's still dealing with ourselves. Whereas with this film, I'm there to serve [Burnat's] voice.\" The Law in These Parts and The Gatekeepers , two of the year's best conflict docs from Israeli directors, definitely -- and unashamedly -- fall into the self-analyzing category described by Davidi. The latter was quickly acquired by Sony Pictures Classics after premiering at JIFF, and played for the first time in North America at Telluride this fall, winning rave reviews. Between Colorado and its official screening at TIFF a few days later, the doc picked up major Oscar buzz, with press on both U.S. coasts now considering it a contender for the Academy Award for best documentary feature. The Gatekeepers consists primarily of interviews with six former heads of the Shin Bet -- Israel's foremost intelligence and security agency -- all of whom have never been interviewed before on screen. Blending high-end CGI and archival footage to powerful effect, the former spymasters talk about their roles in Israel's decades-long counter-terrorism campaign, discussing their methods and decisions, and reflecting on whether the ends ultimately justified the means. Topics on the table include torture, terror, assassination and collateral damage, but what makes the doc so compelling is the frankness with which the subjects speak. The film, made with a budget of more than _1 million (US$1.29 million) for Israel's Channel 1 (which will air it as a five-part series) owes a lot stylistically to Errol Morris's landmark doc The Fog of War , which Gatekeepers director Dror Moreh (pictured below) described as being \"a textbook\" for his film. The filmmaker spent between 12 and 15 hours with each interviewee, grilling them about their tenures as heads of the organization. \"I had a few researchers who would prepare at least 70 or 80 pages of bio for me for each one of them, which I read very carefully,\" Moreh explains. \"Sometimes I had 20 pages of questions -- so I knew from the beginning how I would conduct the interviews. \"But I knew also that I wanted them to take place in an environment where they would feel very comfortable. So I tried to do it in their homes or offices, and though the interviews were on green-screen, I brought the green-screen to their houses.\" Moreh says that culling such a huge amount of footage into a lean, 95-minute feature was the most difficult task of the whole process. \"I left my kidney, my heart, my hands and a lot of my organs on the editing room floor,\" he jokes. \"There were a lot of things that went out that were amazing, but at the end of the day I wanted to reach a wider audience. And I think the fact that I knew that I could do five chapters for Israeli television acted as a release mechanism, to allow me to give up a lot of the stories which I thought were essential for the movie.\" The other key challenge for the filmmaker, when dealing with so much interview footage, was ensuring he conveyed each subject's views in as fair and balanced a fashion as possible. \"It was very important for me also to not manipulate what they say, because I have a lot of power,\" offers Moreh. \"I could've manipulated their words very easily. But I didn't want to create a context that was not something they believe or support.\" That said, Moreh does not believe that it is possible for a filmmaker to make a doc without inputting his or her own point of view. \"Every time someone holds a camera and interviews someone, he puts his point of view in,\" he offers. \"Even a newsreel has a point of view. Someone tries to tell you that he's bringing both sides, but I've never believed that. Every documentary has a very strong point of view behind it, and definitely I came to this film with a point of view which I wanted to emphasize.\" Indeed, despite the success of many of this year's best Israel/Palestine docs, controversy never tends to be far away. And the most frequent criticisms tend to regard balance, fairness and neutrality -- something difficult to achieve with documentaries at the best of times. Despite the fact that criticism of Israel's role in the Occupied Territories in The Gatekeepers comes entirely from top-level Israelis, the film still drew fire from some audience members at the Toronto International Film Festival, with one exasperated viewer at a post-screening Q&A asking Moreh when someone was \"finally going to make a film offering the Israeli point of view.\" Passions run high, but as far as Weston is concerned, JIFF's role -- and to a certain degree that of most film festivals -- is simply to pick the best films available in any given year. When programming a controversial doc, \"I don't find myself going, 'Oh God, we have to go and find another opposing view,'\" she says. \"We program the best of what's out there; it's not our job to say, 'We need a pro-Palestinian [film], a pro-Israel, a pro-left wing or pro-right wing...' I don't feel that responsibility.\" Cinephil MD Philippa Kowarsky (pictured above) agrees that the notion of balance is not an important consideration for her. As head of the Tel Aviv-based distributor, she sees plenty of docs on the Israel/Palestine conflict each year. But to make the cut for her indie's small slate, docs have to be exceptional, which for her is \"something that couldn't have been made five year ago -- it has to be relevant, current and different in its form for 2012, 2013 and 2014.\" Cinephil is handling distribution of The Gatekeepers (on which Kowarsky is also a producer) outside of North America, as well as Dan Setton's State 194 (pictured below), which follows Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad's quest to have Palestine recognized by the United Nations as an independent state. While balance is not a key concern for her, Kowarsky says her own views on the conflict do very much influence the kinds of films she would pick up for distribution. \"I would never sell a film, even if it was brilliant, if I didn't agree with it ideologically,\" she says. \"I wouldn't take a film that I felt was too right-wing. How could I sit and persuade someone to buy a film that I didn't believe in? If I can't relate to the premise and I don't believe in it, I can't sell it. I don't feel I owe anyone in the world a balanced slate.\" Looking to the future, the probability of resolution -- twin state or otherwise -- to the ongoing conflict appears remote at present, which means there will likely be many more Israel/Palestine docs to come. Nevertheless, there is a palpable sense that documentaries about the ongoing struggle are evolving. \"The conflict is a little bit like a stage right now, where we know the actors, we know what is happening -- and the film community has seen so many films about the subject,\" offers Davidi. \"So now it's about what kind of thing we can do with the known players, which makes for a very different approach to documentary. As filmmakers, we have to be more creative and find new ways to shape the story, with new strategies, understandings and ideas.\" The Gatekeepers plays at IDFA in Amsterdam on November 17, 19, 20, 21 and 23 \n",
            "Welcome, one and all, to TheCheckingLine.com, your source for unique hockey insight from Aztk and myself, and many more to come. While the two of us are Habs fans, we are truly hockey fans in general, and we will try our best to bring you insight from all around the league, and build a community that will rival the biggest and best hockey sites out there. So, register today, join the forums, and who knows? If you're good enough, maybe we'll make you a blogger. Anyway, enough with the petty attempts to get people to join the site, I do actually have some content for all of you today, involving some news coming out of Habs Land. First up: Price's new mask, courtesy of HabsInsideOut.com. It's certainly an improvement over the Garth Brooks mask. Not happy he's back to the red pads though, some people with certain superstitions seem to think that the red pads are what caused his demise last year. It's just training camp though, so I'm not going to blow up any cars just yet. So, obviously, training camp has started and this city is slowly starting to buzz with hockey fever. The first preseason game is Thursday (the first game was last night, first televised game is Toronto's first game on Wednesday on TSN2), but Montreal fans won't be left thirsty, as 5 games in 5 nights is sure to quench our thurst for hockey, for the time being. The new players seem to be adapting well to life in this city. Some players, like Gionta and Gomez, as well as Subban, have already started to learn French. Which begs the question, are they truly trying to embrace the culture in Quebec, or are they lobbying both the organization and the fans in order to obtain, oh, I don't know... the captaincy? With news coming out that the captaincy had been offered to Andrei Markov, and that he turned the opportunity to wear the C down, the race for the captaincy is wide open. With no clear-cut frontrunner, and a bunch of new players, it could be almost anyone who will end up donning the C when the season starts. For all we know, it could be no one donning the C on October 1st in Toronto. Personally, that doesn't bother me. The media will be all up in arms if that does happen, quoting tradition and referring to the past and how this team has always had a captain who's led the team, but I say, let the players EARN the captaincy. At the ranch retreat at the end of the month, Jacques Martin and his team of coaches should identify the player who performed best during camp... both on the ice and off. The player who best represents what it takes to wear a Captain's C (minus Andrei Markov, who seems to be more focused on playing hockey than learning new languages). Then, give that player the C on an interim basis for the Month of October. Once that month is up, give the C to the best performer from that prior month (again, both on and off the ice). Keep doing this until the right player finally steps up, and you have yourself a captain. The rotating captaincy concept has worked on many teams in many different sports, and why shouldn't it work here? Tradition or not, you don't want to hastily award the C to someone who might not deserve it, and with several players seemingly interested, and seemingly in this city long term, management should take a long, hard look on who deserves to wear it. Once again, I stress that this player should fit the role, both on and off the ice, and not just because he's the best or loudest player on the ice, OR because he seems to be willing to learn french or visit hospitals and set up charities. This player should have it all. But if I had to choose one player, right now, who will make or break this team's success over the next few years, and who I think would be a good fit as captain? Who do YOU think should wear the C? Any ideas on how it should be handed out? Should we even start the season with the captain, or let it decide itself as the season goes on? Please, comment, and please, enjoy the site! Update 2PM: According to RDS, Markov has denied being offered the C. maybe something's being lost in translation, or maybe management is trying to keep it hush, but it's certainly interesting. \n"

        "A: There is no direct way to find out, but if you know the separator (e.g. tab or '\\t' in a tab separated file, or ',' or ';' in a comma separated file), you can count how many times the separator exists in the file and add one to get the number of columns (this is like counting the spaces between your own fingers, which is four, and adding one to get the number of fingers). This may not work if the separator exists within the column contents as well, but that would be bad practice from the original creator of the file.\n",

In brief, both denote strings in Bash, or something that is \"just words\" and not commands, but with double quotes you can insert something \"extra\" within the string, e.g. a variable or even a command. From the Bash manual (here: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual):\n",
        "* Enclosing characters in single quotes (') preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.\n",
        "* Enclosing characters in double quotes (\") preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \\\\, [...] The special parameters * and @ have special meaning when in double quotes (see Shell Parameter Expansion).\n",

        "The differences in command behaviour between single and double quote use is not always very easy to uderstand, especially with egrep where you use regular expressions. But if you want to make absolutely sure that e.g. an echo gives you the literal string, use single quotes. If you want to echo a string including a variable, use double quotes. An example below:"
